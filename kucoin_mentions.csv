As a single euro payment system created by the European Union, SEPA support is a major milestone for the KuCoin exchange, which is now active in 207 countries worldwide, serving over 10 million users. The new payment method will be officially launched on January 24, 2022, allowing users from the 36 SEPA member states to deposit EUR into their account and use it to purchase cryptocurrency assets through KuCoin's Fast Buy option.

2022-02-26,Maximize Passive Income in 2022 with KuCoin Exchange Crypto Lending | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist,"Passive income is a great way to generate cash especially for Individuals with low capital who see passive income as a crucial aspect of their finances. If you are someone looking to generate a steady source of passive income is via cryptocurrency. However, with the constant market fluctuations and immense volatility, investing, at all times is not a viable option. A more reliable and sustainable way is what KuCoin Exchange presents through crypto lending and KuCoin Earn.

What is Crypto lending?

To put it simply, crypto lending is an innovative investment strategy in which investors loan cryptocurrency to borrowers in return for interest. It should be noted that this is not a loan with no collateral. In exchange for the loan, the lender receives interest from the borrower, while borrowers deposit crypto assets as collateral to secure investors’ investment. This acts as a guarantee for the lender; if something goes wrong, this collateral is the compensation.

Passive Income With KuCoin Exchange Crypto Lending

Since its inception in September 2017, KuCoin crypto exchange has evolved to become one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. Several KuCoin Exchange Review in 2022, rank the platform to be the number 1 altcoin exchange in the world. It boasts over 8 million registered users from 207 countries. KuCoin Exchange has the most versatile lending feature called “Crypto Lending”. With this feature, you can earn passive income by lending your KuCoin Shares (KCS) to users who want to trade but don’t have enough KuCoin Shares (KCS) to do so themselves.

● Attractive Perks

KuCoin Exchange provides some attractive perks to cryptocurrency holders, including crypto lending and a KCS bonus, among other things. With a term period of 7 days, 14 days, or 28 days, KuCoin exchange offers the highest return on lending stable coins. At times return could be as high as 730% APR on a 14-day term. It also provides relatively greater yields on coins such as ATOM and DAO, with APRs ranging from 73 percent to 73 percent for a 14-day lock-in period.

KuCoin Exchange currently supports around 90 digital assets for lending, even those not common on other crypto lending platforms. USDT loans are the most popular among traders until now. These tokens include more established coins like ETH and SOL as well as popular meme-coins like SHIB.

Leveraging the issues of traditional financial institutions like credit check requirements, regulations, and outdated technology, the crypto lending market makes it easier to lend and borrow swiftly and easily. Borrowers must put up collateral to qualify for a loan, so your assets are safe. On KuCoin Exchange, lenders have two options: Manual Lend or Auto-Lend. One concern with lending is the speed with which loans are repaid. In such cases, the Manual Lend option is not optimal because the earning time is short.

Earning Passive Income with KuCoin Earn

KuCoin Exchange provides diverse passive income options on its platform. KuCoin Earn with high yields, high flexibility, and multiple staking options, is another great passive revenue-generating stream. It is a cutting-edge staking platform that allows you to increase your earnings by staking profits and POL revenues. The POL mining power evaluation system calculates POL income.

KuCoin Earn offerings are highly adaptive and flexible—enabling users to choose the ideal product and trade freely on the market. Products, including ATOM, TRX, ZRX, IOST, and many more are supported.

Best Practices For Crypto Lending

Now you know how crypto lending can be a steady source of passive income. However, before making any form of investment, it’s ideal to be well-versed with the best practices:

● Research Is Your Savior

This cannot be overstated for many things in crypto. Your research can help you tremendously and lending is no different. You don’t want to accidentally trust a poorly secured platform or worse, a scam. Your best bet is to go with lending platforms or smart contracts that have been well audited for security and have a good track record.

● Don’t Take Decisions In A Hurry

Don’t borrow cryptocurrency that you intend to cash out of soon. It’s probably pretty obvious, but you can’t sell what you lend to someone else. Also, don’t forget that even with the best security check, hacks can still happen in the crypto world. Just in case the worst would happen to the platform you are using, it is good to keep in mind that crypto can sometimes get lost.

● Set Your Parameters

You should make sure you know in advance when you will get your crypto back and how much interest you will earn from it. Most importantly, there is a good backup plan in place for you in case the borrower fails to repay you. You should ensure that the platform or smart contract you are using will continue to return your crypto, either through insurance or collateral that the borrower had to lock away.

Kucoin Exchange – Building Trust On Top Of Passive Income

When it comes to crypto lending, KuCoin Exchange has established itself as the most trustworthy platform. It has gone beyond ordinary measures to provide users with a secure, sustainable platform for earning passive income.

What is KuCoin?

Kucoin is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers users the ability to buy, sell and trade their crypto-assets. It describes itself as a hybrid exchange with features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. However, the long-term goal is to transition into a completely decentralized exchange. In addition to the traditional trading options, it also offers the added features of margin, futures, and peer-to-peer (p2p) trading. Users also have the option to stake or lend their tokens in order to earn passive income. KuCoin also has relatively low trading fees when compared to its competitors, which makes it an attractive option for cryptocurrency traders. In 2018, KuCoin secured $20 million in Round A funding from IDG Capital and Matrix Partners.

Nicknamed as ‘The People’s Exchange’, KuCoin is deemed as beginner-friendly and is a great option for traders. It also enables most of the trading fees to be returned to the community members. This is done through its native token, known as the KuCoin Token or KCS (previously known as KuCoin Shares). Holders of KCS are entitled to a daily reward. Users with as few as 6 KCS tokens are eligible for the reward, making it a great way for beginners to earn passive income.

Who Created KuCoin?

KuCoin was created in 2017 by eight co-founders. Johnny Lyu is the current CEO of the project. KuCoin is based in Singapore, while its headquarters are in Seychelles. Since its launch in 2017, KuCoin has become one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, with over 10 million users and a significant presence in more than 200 countries. According to its team, KuCoin is committed to exploring disruptive technologies and genius ideas in order to enhance crypto adoption among the masses. KuCoin is dubbed as ‘The People’s Exchange’

What is KuCoin Token?

KuCoin Token or KCS is the native token of the KuCoin exchange. Initially launched with the name KuCoin Shares, it was later rebranded as KuCoin Token, in January 2021. KCS is issued as an ERC-20 token. The first public token sale for KCS was held from 15th August to 1st September 2017. A total of 200 million tokens were created, which means that KCS is a deflationary token because no new tokens will be minted. There is also a plan to buy back and burn almost 50% of the total supply.

35% of the total supply has been allocated for the founders, while 15% has been allocated for the early investors, influencers, and consultants. 25% of the total supply was put up for sale on an annual sale, with the last sale happening on 2nd September 2021.

The KCS token allows users to have several benefits on the exchange. Users can avail discounts on their trading fees. In addition to this, users can participate in the various features offered by the exchange, such as KuCoin Spotlight. Users can also choose to participate in the Pool-X program using KCS. KuCoin rewards the holders of KCS as well, by giving them a bonus every single day. In the future, when KuCoin becomes a completely decentralized exchange, the KCS token will become its governance token, allowing holders to vote and decide upon the future development of the project.

KCS Crypto: How it Works?

We can see that in many ways KCS is quite similar to BNB in that it allows the users of its exchange to attain discounts in trading fees. Up to 20% discounts can be availed by the users of KCS on the KuCoin exchange. Similarly, KCS is also a deflationary currency, and just like BNB, it is also to be bought back and burned, until a specific amount of tokens is left.

In the case of KCS, the total supply of tokens minted is 200 million. KuCoin implements the buying back and burning of the KCS token. 10% of all the profits are used to buy back KCS tokens and burn them. This will be done until the total supply of KCS reaches 100 million tokens. Initially, the burning was done on a quarterly basis, but now it happens once every single month. In total, more than 3 million KCS tokens have been burned so far. This amounts to almost $37 million in KCS tokens.

KuCoin also rewards the holders of the KCS token. 50% of the total profit of the exchange is given back to the users as a reward. To be eligible for this reward, a user has to own at least 6 KCS tokens. This means that the entry point is quite low, which presents an excellent opportunity for people who are light in their pockets to earn a decent passive income. Another great thing about this is that these rewards are given out daily, which saves the hassle of waiting for a long period of time.

KCS is also an integral part of the KCC blockchain. KuCoin Community Chain or KCC is a decentralized blockchain network, created by KuCoin community members and fans. It is a high-performance blockchain, featuring low transaction fees, low latency in addition to being secure. The KCC employs the use of the Proof-of-Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, which allows the block confirmation time to be reduced to just 3 seconds. KCS is used exclusively as the fuel and native token of the network, and the number of KCS addresses on the network has increased exponentially. KCC already has emerging projects on its network, with the likes of Mojitoswap and Kuswap already being hosted on the platform.

What Is KCS Crypto: Concerns

One of the biggest concerns regarding KuCoin is the fact that it isn’t licensed to operate in the US. Although users from the US can open their accounts on the exchange, they receive limited trading capabilities. Furthermore, there is always the danger that if a crackdown occurs on KuCoin, then the users won’t be able to withdraw their assets.

Security is also a pretty big concern for KuCoin. On 25th September 2020, a group of hackers stole more than $275 million worth of cryptocurrency from the exchange. This was seen as a major security breach, and even though KuCoin identified the hackers later on, but still it casts a big doubt on the overall security infrastructure of the exchange.

Where Can You Buy KCS Crypto?

KCS crypto can be purchased on major crypto exchanges like KuCoin, similar to how one would buy any other cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you’re willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your set limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current market price and have your order filled almost instantly. If you are interested in trading KCS, you can do so by visiting KuCoin.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1rdWNvaW4tdG9rZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

However, it is worthy to note that a lot of scams and other such activities have grown in number. From outright scams to elaborate schemes, there is a myriad of ways an investor or an organization can lose their money.

Of late, a flare of scam coin listings incoming for fake Metaverse projects has started to circulate on Reddit. While many identify the fake scams at the outset, some realize it after falling into the trap. Well, one such instance is of White Whale.

Kucoin Listing Rug

White Whale, an arbitrage platform built on Terra is currently facing the heat as it became the latest victim to a rug pull.

The platform was rugged out of ‘listing fees’ by a fake Kucoin team in a very elaborate scam. Overall, the protocol lost 2,510,000 WHALE tokens. This, at press time, equates to around $510k. The team was quick to release a blog to narrate the whole story.

Well, on 29 December, the affected protocol announced the listing on one of the largest crypto exchanges, Kucoin. However, it turned out to be an ugly story. An array of confusion took the centre stage. Curiously, the team earlier tweeted: “The WHALE token that was announced as being listed on Kucoin is an ERC20 token and is not us.” Later apologized for the same.

(Miss)listing opportunities- How?

Over the past several weeks, months, even years there have been many exchanges reaching out to protocols in regards to listing opportunities. This was the case here as “fake” Kucoin executives did the same.

Needless to say, it doesn’t seem out of the ordinary at first. Over further discussion, ‘Multiple White Whale team members and advisors were invited’ into the circle with these so-called Kucoin members. The blog added:

“It was an organized and co-ordinated team of people running a complex operation. They also leveraged the fact that another WHALE token was being listed on Kucoin at the same time to further obfuscate the situation.”

This is where things went south. Post a joint marketing schedule which included both parties- ‘Kucoin did not publish anything on their official channels.,’ the blog opined. After some further investigation it became clear that these were ‘not really Kucoin agents, they were scammers.’

The team shared the aforementioned incident on Twitter that read as:

We are choosing transparency. We will also be facing the community directly and answering any questions regarding this on our regular Community Update Call today at 1 pm EST. We have several positive updates to deliver on the call as well. We encourage everyone to be there. — White Whale (@WhiteWhaleTerra) December 31, 2021

Damage?

Well, there was bloodshed. The blog stated,

“The damage was 2,510,000 WHALE from the non-circulating supply and 50,000 USDT from our team development funds, which was sent from our team multisig.”

Meanwhile, the native token WHALE suffered following this heist. The steep decline in the graph below highlights the same. The token was trading at the $0.2 mark.

Next steps

As it goes in the crypto universe, exchanges tend to reimburse affected individuals. The team here took similar steps. The executives asserted:

“In order to rectify this, the team has purchased the equal amount of WHALE from the open market and removed them from the circulating supply, so that the community does not have to absorb the dilution.”

Overall, different platforms have lent support to the flagship protocol.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS93aGl0ZS13aGFsZS1mYWxscy12aWN0aW0tdG8tYS1mYWtlLWt1Y29pbi1saXN0aW5nLXRoZS1wcm90b2NvbC1sb3Nlcy1taWxsaW9ucy1vZi10b2tlbnMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hbWJjcnlwdG8uY29tL3doaXRlLXdoYWxlLWZhbGxzLXZpY3RpbS10by1hLWZha2Uta3Vjb2luLWxpc3RpbmctdGhlLXByb3RvY29sLWxvc2VzLW1pbGxpb25zLW9mLXRva2Vucy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-01-06,First Cardano native asset listed on top tier CEXs: Revuto trading on KuCoin and Gate.io - Cointelegraph,"January 6, 2021 – Blockchain startup Revuto has announced that their REVU token will be the first-ever Cardano native asset to be listed on tier 1 centralized exchanges KuCoin and Gate.io.

Revuto, the subscription manager company behind the first mobile wallet and ICO on Cardano, achieved record growth in the past four months since its launch and is now once again leading the way by listing REVU.

“We are proud to make history again with REVU, after being the first ICO, publishing the 1st Cardano lite wallet and breaking records with our growth — we are now the first to list on tier 1 CEXs KuCoin and Gate.io. The process included multiple legal openings for our utility token from top legal firms, including both United States and European Union legislations, with audits being in process and led by the global leader blockchain security. We also partnered with Skynet Trading for institutional-grade liquidity solutions. Our ethos is to work only with the best; to ensure our customers and investors enjoy the best products and returns. It may take longer, and is often the more difficult way — but it's the right way to build long-term value”, Revuto’s CEO and co-founder Vedran Vukmancommented.

Starting Jan. 7, all retail investors can buy REVU on KuCoin and Gate.io and join the fast-growing startup on their journey.

About Revuto

Revuto is an active subscription management DApp built on Cardano to help people save money on their subscriptions. In May, through ICO, the company raised $10M in minutes and has received 3 million early sign-ups for the app. Starting from August, more than 300 thousand users worldwide registered with the app, making Revuto the fastest-growing fintech startup in the world. As a result, Revuto won the award for the fastest-growing consumer product at the recent World Blockchain Summit in Dubai.

At the moment, the company is preparing to launch its virtual debit card to manage subscription seasonality and allow users to pay for their subscriptions with Cardano native tokens. Later in the year, Revuto will introduce DeFi services to help people pay less for their subscriptions than they would pay using FIAT currency. In that regard, one of the most significant announcements will be the launch of liquidity pools for micro-lending and borrowing. The setup will allow Revuto users to provide liquidity to other Revuto users and earn yield. In contrast, others will be allowed to borrow funds from those pools to pay for their subscriptions even if they don't have the funds to do so. Most importantly, the ecosystem and tokenomics are designed around the real-world use case that allows Revuto's cutting-edge blockchain product to stay sustainable regardless of crypto market conditions.

2022-01-13,KuCoin: Opens Support for TRC20-TUSD - Tron Spark,"KuCoin, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges in the world had announced that they have enabled deposits and withdrawals for the TRON-based TrueUSD.

Asides from TRC20-TUSD, they also have support from other TrueUSD on different blockchains such as Avalanche (AVAX-TUSD) and Ethereum (ERC20-TUSD).

The TRC20-TUSD had been one of the most popular and preferred stablecoins in the TRON blockchain alongside the TRC20-USDT, TRC20-USDJ and TRC20-USDC.

What is KuCoin?

KuCoin is a Singaporean-based cryptocurrency exchange that was originally launched in Hong Kong last 2017. They have been one of the top crypto exchanges in the world and are referred to as the “People’s Exchange” due to its large growing userbase across the globe.

There are over 370+ cryptocurrencies available for trade in their platform and is always adding new coins to their exchange from time to time. The exchange also allows users to invest through the KuCoin Shares, which is the native token of the exchange and allows holders to receive rewards by simply staking or holding them on their accounts.

Asides from the mentioned features above, they also have KuCoin Futures which allows users to trade Bitcoin futures and since 2018, KuCoin has formed a partnership with European-based payment provider Simplex that allowed users to deposit real-world funds (fiat currency) with a debit or credit card.

They have been one of the safest cryptocurrency exchanges in the market and over the years they have maintained their high volume of trades.

Overall, KuCoin is one of the most trusted exchanges out there and not only does it give you access to over 370+ cryptocurrency pairs, users can also trade crypto-specific indexes and Bitcoin futures.

What is TrueUSD?

TrueUSD is the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar. The TRC20-TUSD token is TRON’s version of the TrueUSD on the blockchain and it adopts the fungible-token-friendly TRC20 standard, which is almost the same as ETHTRON and BTCTRON.

Every TUSD token would be a bridge to convert value between fiat money and digital currency. The USD-pegged stablecoin has a 300 million circulating supply with over 300,000 unique addresses on the network.

🚀#TUSD and @cronos_chain reached a strategic partnership. ✅As the first regulated stable coin fully backed by the US Dollar, $TUSD is supported by 10+ chains. ⭐️#TUSD will bring more transparency to the multi-chain ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/V3nAI9GXmF — TrueUSD (@tusd_official) January 11, 2022

TRON-based stablecoins such as the TRC20-TUSD had been popular within the blockchain due to their instant transactions and low fees compared to the other TUSD from other blockchains.

We are confident that more exchanges, wallets, and other platforms would be supporting the TRON-based TrueUSD this year and as Justin Sun tweeted awhile ago, expect big things to happen to TRON this 2022.

2022-02-26,KuCoin Exchange Crypto Social Trading Feature is Here: 2022 Review - CryptoSlate,"Press Release KuCoin Exchange Crypto Social Trading Feature is Here: 2022 Review News Desk / / 4 min read

Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release. Readers should conduct their own research prior to taking any actions related to the content mentioned in this article. Learn more ›

There are a lot of social media platforms where one would find a thriving community of crypto influencers including Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram, and Discord. But the information you find across all these platforms are scattered, providing no coherent direction. It is also cumbersome to manage so many accounts and handle so much information without a way to streamline them for proper screening.

“Social trading” in the context of cryptocurrency refers to the implementation of trading strategies based on information collected from social media interactions. For instance, MoneyZG is a reputed crypto investor and educator with a lot of followers. These followers look up to him for trading advice and would often mimic his techniques. Similarly, a crypto influencer on Twitter might be influencing a lot of traders to follow their suit. This is what forms the crux of crypto social trading. When social media influence informs your trading decision, you automatically become a part of this game.

A crypto social trading platform or exchange offers a decentralized network for crypto newbies to connect with avid traders and learn from them. The platform also consolidates crypto newsfeeds and opinion pieces among other things for better resourcing of information and allows users to use these insights and complete a trade then and there. One such platform is KuCoin S which is creating a prototype for crypto social trading. Understanding this platform in detail can provide a better idea of what this new brand of crypto trading should look like.

KuCoin S: Transforming Social Trading

KuCoin Exchange has been planning to build a crypto platform where all the participants can gather and share useful information. Trading is just one action amongst all the fun things it explores and innovates with social trading function. Several KuCoin Exchange Reviews in 2022 show the platform transforming into the first and biggest social trading platform. To this end, KuCoin S was launched on October 22, 2021. That being said, here are some of the key features that make KuCoin S a standout amongst its peers.

● Easy-to-Obtain Trusted Crypto News Feed

It feels overwhelming to sift through an ocean of crypto news mingled with misinformation and fads. It takes time and energy for a trader to find the info with real value, leading to the right trading decisions.

KuCoin S offers diversified and trusted crypto info feed which contains token price moves, new listing, crypto news, trending coin, sector, portfolio, or topics, etc., “gradually customizing feed through AI-based algorithms and machine learning.” Hence, each KuCoin user can make easier trading decisions on the basis of all the info provided.

Available in the mobile app, all you need to do is swipe down the screen on the homepage to enter the world of KuCoin S and hit the ‘get started’ button. If you see anything interesting, tap it and take a closer look. For instance, you can check out the top gainers’ portfolio or the latest news from the top media to make an informed investment decision.

● All-round Social Features

KuCoin S supports social features such as like, follow, comment, and share. You can show your support to a specific token, add it to your favorite list or portfolio, or leave your comments on a trending coin or topic. Your actions and opinions may help others make better decisions. Likewise, you can get insights from millions of other users on KuCoin. The KuCoin S community is another feature that offers users the chance to learn from the experience of crypto influencers and avid investors and Interacting with them.

There are several other exchange apps or crypto media apps that also offer a diversified news update. But what distinguishes KuCoin crypto exchange from the rest is the sense of interaction that one will find here. Gone are the days of browsing news feeds passively; the idea is to turn your browsing into an action. KuCoin S makes it possible by making available users’ profiles with high ROIs for others to follow by tapping the ‘like’ button and comment on them. The same applies to trending tokens or news.

Trading Simplified, Return Rate Increased

KuCoin S simplifies the trading process for users by removing the order book and order type functions. Users can simply choose a token, tap the buy button, enter the trading password, enter the purchase amount to complete a trade. The profit and loss will be displayed on the portfolio page.

In addition, the copy trading feature allows users to browse the most successful strategies on the platform, and create a portfolio that meets their return expectations and risk preference in one click. The advantage is obvious, users have the chance to get higher profits by simply checking and copying a trading strategy that’s been proven by the market. One can further customize their portfolio. All one needs to do is:

Tap any investment portfolio and swipe up for the details and select the copy button.

Tap the edit coin button to make adjustments if required

Hit the next button to complete the portfolio

Check returns and share it with others

One can also create a postcard of their best-performing ROI and share it on social media.

Final Thoughts

Crypto social trading platforms could be a boon to new investors looking for access to genuine information and educational content. On one hand, experienced traders can use the platform as a channel to broadcast their own trading recommendations. On the other, investors can follow them and copy their techniques to build winning trading strategies. These platforms would often display the trading history of pro members and successful strategies for others to emulate.

Platforms like KuCoin S help new traders interact and learn from tenured crypto trading influencers and improve their trading approaches.

2022-01-27,How To Make Quick Cash With Crypto - GOBankingRates,"©Shutterstock.com

Cryptocurrency is synonymous with speed, both in terms of fortunes made and fortunes lost. If you’re willing to shoulder the risk, there are many ways that you can make quick cash with crypto. Just be advised that dabbling in cryptocurrency isn’t for everyone.

Although news reports love to highlight the incredible gains that cryptocurrencies can generate — witness Shiba Inu’s unbelievable 49 million percent gain in 2021, for example — they don’t often tout the incredible losses that some investors suffer. Latecomers who bought Shiba Inu at its all-time high, for example, are now sitting on losses of around 90%.

But as long as you are fully aware of the risks you are taking by diving into the world of cryptocurrency, there are definitely ways you can potentially make quick cash. Here are just a few options.

Trade It

The easiest way to potentially earn lots in crypto is to simply trade it. Exchanges like Coinbase offer a wide variety of cryptocurrencies that you can trade, from “OG” cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum to up-and-comers, like Solana and Polygon. Slowly but surely, more and more brokers are offering access to cryptocurrency, including Robinhood and SoFi, and it seems inevitable that cryptocurrency trading will move more and more into the mainstream over time.

Investing for Everyone

Trading cryptocurrency is much like trading stocks, except crypto trading is the very definition of speculation. Without any intrinsic value, the price of cryptocurrency is incredibly volatile, as investors tug-of-war over whether or not certain cryptos have a more viable path to future acceptance and usage. But it’s this very volatility that affords crypto investors the chance to make quick cash.

Mine It

Mining cryptocurrency is much harder now than when Bitcoin first hit the scene in 2009, but there’s still money to be made by dedicated mining operations. While you could formerly earn some Bitcoin by mining it from your home computer, nowadays crypto mining is big business, with well-funded companies hosting server farms filling entire rooms in faraway countries.

Currently, miners are rewarded with 6.25 Bitcoin for every block of transactions they validate on the blockchain, an amount that halves about every four years. At current Bitcoin prices, this translates to a payout of about $229,000. But the complexity involved in getting that reward is so high that many miners never earn a single Bitcoin. By way of reference, the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin was at a reference level of 1. As of 2022, that difficulty rate is now more than 22 trillion.

Investing for Everyone

The bottom line is you can make quick cash mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but the difficulty level is so high that it’s still a risky proposition, particularly for new miners.

Store It

Strange as it may sound, there are a handful of cryptocurrencies that actually pay you a dividend, although it’s typically dubbed a “reward.” Names like Neo and KuCoin actually pay you a reward if you buy and hold them. KuCoin, for example, pays its holders 50% of all the exchange trading fees that it generates every day, as long as you hold a minimum of 6 KuCoin tokens. These dividends are paid in the form of additional KuCoin tokens. Other dividend-paying cryptos have their own reward structure. You won’t likely get rich overnight by owning and storing select cryptos, but they can be a nice form of daily passive income.

Arbitrage It

Since cryptocurrency is still in its infancy in terms of trading as an investment, the exact price you’re quoted for a crypto might vary slightly among the different exchanges. Professional investors refer to this type of opportunity as arbitrage, as you can buy a crypto on one exchange at a lower price and simultaneously sell it on another at a slightly higher price to achieve a “no-risk” profitable trade. Arbitrage is a great idea in concept, but it’s hard enough to pull off successfully on regulated markets like the stock market. Trying to arbitrage cryptocurrencies is best left to the experts, although it can be a way to make quick cash.

Investing for Everyone

Accept It as Payment

More and more merchants are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as payment, the same as they would with cash or credit cards. This type of business model is a bit of a gamble, as the cryptocurrency you accept today at a price of $22,000 could drop within a matter of hours or even minutes. But the opposite is also true, of course. Merchants who accept cryptocurrency payments when the market is tanking might very well luck into quick profits if market sentiment turns favorable. With some luck, your business profits could double in a relatively short period of time if your crypto gamble pays off.

2022-01-13,How To Get Started With DeFi Kingdoms - Cryptosrus,"In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to get JEWEL tokens in DeFi Kingdoms so that you can start taking advantage of its gamified DeFi platform.

Covered In This DeFi Kingdoms Guide:

Getting ONE Tokens Onto MetaMask

Getting Started On DeFi Kingdoms

Trading For JEWEL Tokens

DeFi Kingdoms (JEWEL) is one of the hottest new blockchain games. It’s a unique solution to an overlooked problem: making DeFi farming fun for the average user. If you’re looking for an alternative to traditional DeFi liquidity pools, I’ll walk you through the steps to get onto DeFi Kingdoms.

Getting ONE Tokens Onto MetaMask

The first thing you’ll need to get on DeFi Kingdoms is some Harmony (ONE) tokens. The game is based on the Harmony blockchain, so ONE is the native transaction fee token for the platform.

To get some ONE, I’ll be using the KuCoin exchange, however, other exchanges that have native ONE tokens, such as Gate.io or Binance.us, should work great as well.

From the KuCoin trading page, I’ve bought some ONE tokens, as you can see below. If you’re new to KuCoin, click here to check out our guide on how to use the crypto exchange.

As a reminder, you don’t need to buy tokens on the KuCoin exchange; if you have ONE tokens already on another exchange, the withdrawal process should work relatively the same for you.

Once you’ve bought your ONE tokens, from the assets page on KuCoin, select “Transfer” under your main account tab and choose ONE tokens. Enter the amount of ONE you want to transfer from your trading account to your main account, then hit Confirm.

Now that your ONE tokens are sitting in your main account, it’s time to withdraw them to MetaMask.

You’ll need a MetaMask crypto wallet that’s connected to the Harmony mainnet network in order to load ONE tokens onto your MetaMask natively. Thankfully, Harmony has provided a clear guide here on how to easily add the Harmony mainnet to your MetaMask, so check that out first before continuing forward.

Now that you’ve connected your MetaMask to Harmony, open your MetaMask browser tab and copy the address at the top of your digital wallet.

TIP: As you can see, there is some dust ONE tokens sitting in the wallet already. It’s always a good idea to keep a small amount of the native asset in your wallet to use for transaction fees on various DeFi platforms. Thankfully, Harmony offers extremely cheap fees, so you don’t need much to make a good amount of transactions.

This is an important next step: paste this MetaMask address into the Harmony blockchain explorer website here. As you can see, when I paste my wallet address, the explorer shows me the Harmony-native address that you have to use to load ONE onto MetaMask.

Copy that Harmony wallet address (not provided in this picture — your wallet address will be different) and then head back to KuCoin.

From the KuCoin assets page, select “Withdraw” and choose ONE. As you can see, I’ve entered my Harmony-native address, not my MetaMask address. Select ONE for the Network, and enter the amount of ONE you’ll be withdrawing.

KuCoin charges a single ONE token withdrawal fee, which you can check the price of here.

After that, hit “Confirm,” enter your security measures on KuCoin to withdraw the funds, and wait for a couple of minutes for the ONE tokens to appear in your MetaMask.

DeFi Kingdoms Guide: Getting Started

Now that you’ve got ONE on MetaMask, head to the home page of DeFi Kingdoms here.

Click “Play,” and you’ll be prompted to connect your MetaMask. Once you’ve connected, you should be able to create your DeFi Kingdoms character, as shown here.

Once you’ve created your character, you can go through the tutorial to take a tour around the DeFi Kingdoms map.

DeFi Kingdoms Guide: Trading for JEWEL Tokens

Once you’ve gotten yourself familiar, you’ll need to get some JEWEL tokens to interact with the in-game ecosystem. The whole game runs on JEWEL; whether that’s for farming rewards in liquidity pools, summoning, or going on quests, JEWEL fuels it all.

To buy some JEWEL, head to the Marketplace at the center of the map. This is what it should look like.

The marketplace has a few different uses, but for getting started, click on the trader on the left to open DeFi Kingdoms’ in-game decentralized exchange (DEX).

We’ll be swapping From ONE To JEWEL, so select the tokens and input the amount of ONE you’d like to swap. If you’re interested in the current JEWEL price, click here. Then, click “Swap” and confirm the transaction, and you’re done!

You’ve now successfully joined the DeFi Kingdoms ecosystem and can start using the game’s various DeFi protocols to maximize your yields on your crypto. The game offers liquidity pools, JEWEL staking, quests, and more, so be sure to check out our overview of DeFi Kingdoms to get started today!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vaG93LXRvLWdldC1zdGFydGVkLXdpdGgtZGVmaS1raW5nZG9tcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-01-17,Chingari’s GARI token to make historic debut on 6 top crypto exchanges - Cointelegraph,"Mumbai, Jan. 17, 2022 — Chingari, the leading video sharing app in India, has achieved another first with the historic parallel listing of its native GARI token on six of the world’s leading centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

Breaking new ground yet again, GARI has become the world’s first cryptocurrency to launch simultaneously on six trading platforms — Huobi Global, FTX, KuCoin, Gate.io, OKEx and MEXC Global.

GARI is the native cryptocurrency token of Chingari, a short-video sharing platform that now ranks as the No. 1 social media application in India’s Google Play Store. The GARI token was launched in October 2021 amid great fanfare by the company’s Bollywood superstar brand ambassador Salman Khan and followed up with a record-breaking initial DEX offering on the SolRazr launchpad last month.

The GARI token is built on Solana, an Indian-developed alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, which offers the advantage of much faster transaction speeds and lower associated costs. GARI is a social token that will empower creators on the Chingari platform to establish their own e-commerce spaces, where they can sell physical merchandise, create nonfungible tokens and enable fans to fund their favorite artists.

The aim is to drive a digital economy in which users will also be able to obtain GARI tokens for creating or watching content on the platform.

Chingari is the most popular social media app to experiment with cryptocurrency so far. The app has been downloaded more than 100 million times and counts over 32 million active monthly users, meaning GARI has the key advantage of being able to tap into Chingari’s enormous existing audience. To date, few other cryptocurrency tokens have had such a large potential user base at launch.

GARI’s listing on some of the world’s leading centralized crypto exchanges will generate yet more buzz around Chingari’s innovative project. Huobi Global, FTX, KuCoin and Gate.io are all ranked among the world’s top 10 exchanges in terms of volume traded, traffic and liquidity. OKEx is ranked in the top 20, and MEXC Global sits in 26th place.

“Chingari is bringing the Web3 revolution to the creator economy with its GARI token,” Chingari CEO Sumit Ghosh said in a statement. “GARI will enable 30 million monthly active users of the Chingari short video app to get on-chain. For the first time in the history of blockchain, an app will onboard millions of users on-chain from the day of its launch. The Chingari and GARI teams, and the entire community, are super excited about its launch and listing.”

Traders will be able to buy and sell GARI tokens on Huobi Global, FTX, KuCoin, Gate.io, OKEx and MEXC Global from 1:00 pm UTC on Jan. 18, 2022.

2022-02-16,Stronghold Launches $100 Million Investment Fund - Business Wire,"SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stronghold, a payments and financial infrastructure company, has launched Stronghold Capital to invest $100 Million in pioneering companies and funds across three core areas: overlooked and underrepresented founders and fund managers, the payments and fintech ecosystem, and the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem.

The creation of an investment arm follows a wave of momentum for the Stronghold’s SHx token, now listed on KuCoin, a top-five global currency exchange. Stronghold Capital has invested in a crypto market firm, Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, by committing to a DeFi syndicated loan through Maple Finance, an institutional capital marketplace built on blockchain. Stronghold has also invested in Precursor Ventures, which backs promising seed-stage innovators, and is looking to invest in companies with founders who identify as women, LGBTQ+ or Black, indigenous, people of color (BIPOC).

Stronghold’s business grew five-fold across most measures last year while fulfilling the company's mission to provide fast, secure, and accessible financial services for all. But these industries are multi-layered and complex. The challenges in payments and financial services will take many innovative companies to solve. Stronghold Capital will drive meaningful change through investments in companies with business models that will generate attractive returns while expanding access from Stronghold’s payments ecosystem to the overall financial ecosystem.

Stronghold CEO and co-founder Tammy Camp will serve as fund manager for Stronghold Capital. She advanced growth in fintech and blockchain throughout her earlier roles as partner at 500 Startups, head of growth at Stellar Development Foundation, and adviser to NFX Capital.

“Tammy understands the potential of technology, identifies rising talent, cares about societal reach, and can turn great ideas into realities. We’re excited to have her among this first pool of decentralized finance investors,” said Sidney Powell, CEO and Co-Founder of Maple Finance.

Stronghold’s merchant reward program drew attention in crypto communities last fall for its real-world application of the Stellar-based SHx token toward payment processing fees. Leading up to the KuCoin listing, three other top global digital currency exchanges—ranking 20, 15, and 10—listed SHx over the course of just two months.

Stronghold, as part of its own growth journey, raised capital from accomplished fintech founders, leading companies, and prominent industry advisors. Investors who have supported Stronghold’s rapid growth include: Ron Suber, The Bancorp co-founders Frank Mastrangelo and former CEO Betsy Cohen, Randy Reddig from the founding team of Square, Rob Stavis of Bessemer Venture Partners, Marqeta founder & CEO Jason Gardener, former Oppenheimer CEO, president & chairman Arthur Steinmetz, NerdWallet founder Jake Gibson, SoFi co-founder Dan Macklin, and Xpring now known as RippleX.

""Stronghold Capital will create opportunities to develop new products and business models that improve financial infrastructure for everyone,"" said Camp. “Identifying and investing in emerging talent—especially underrepresented and undervalued founders— stands to benefit the developer community, the fintech industry, and even society as a whole.”

2022-01-14,Tether freezes $150 million in USDT - Cointelegraph,"Tether has added three more Ethereum addresses, holding more than $150 million worth of the Tether (USDT) stablecoin among them, to its blacklist.

As a centralized company, Tether is able to blacklist addresses it believes are involved in crime, money laundering or for any other reason it chooses.

This is the first time Tether has blacklisted an address in 2022, but it added 312 addresses to its blacklist last year and has added 563 since it first did so on Nov. 28, 2017.

Tether has not revealed why the three new addresses were blacklisted. However, it has used its power to blacklist addresses involved in cyberattacks and law enforcement investigations. Following the KuCoin hack in September 2020, Tether froze about $35 million in USDT to prevent hackers from capitalizing on their theft.

There may also be “precautionary reasons” for the blacklisting, such as being associated with scams, which Arcane Asset chief investment officer Eric Wall noted as a reason for a separate Tether freeze in 2020.

Concerns over a lack of decentralization may be a factor driving up adoption of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). It is currently the fourth-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $10.6 billion. The market cap of the decentralized challenger still pales in comparison to USDT, however, which is the fourth-largest crypto overall with a market cap of $78.5 billion.

Do Kwon, founder of Terra, tweeted in response to the news of Tether’s actions that there was no way to blacklist UST addresses.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXRoZXItZnJlZXplcy0xNTAtbWlsbGlvbi1pbi11c2R00gFFaHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RldGhlci1mcmVlemVzLTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLWluLXVzZHQvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-01-04,"What is Skale Network and How To Buy It? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News","The road to adoption may not sound simple in the blockchain space. To this day, most blockchains suffer from scalability and throughput challenges. Though some developments have happened across the blockchain trilemma challenge, still it ain’t enough. That’s where the Skale Network has pitched in to make a difference.

What is the Skale Network?

Skale as an open-source elastic blockchain speeds up the Dapp development. The blockchain works side-ways with the Ethereum chain to provide security and a better user experience. Hence fixing the transaction throughput, finality, and high gas cost issues. This in turn increases the storage capacity of the base layer. Thus broadening the horizon of use-cases on the base layer.

Is Skale Network Worth Investing?

Scalability and high throughput are the need of the hour in the blockchain space. If the technology goes mainstream in 2022 as anticipated by recent investment sentiments, it would need more scope for expansion. In such times, if enterprises embrace DLT, they can’t withstand a crypto-kitty event. Hence projects that empower the base layer are bound to explode. Skale Network has the potential to bring DeFi, NFT, and Metaverse to the masses. With 2022 expected to be the year for NFTs and metaverse, Skale is a good investment. It will help users transact ETH for negligible fees. With layer 2’s like Polygon exploding, Skale would most probably meet the same fate.

What is the future price prediction of Skale Network?

2022

In 2022, Skale could reach $0.34 as its highest level. The average trading zone would hover around $0.25 to $0.29 levels.

2023

2023 might see further adoption of Skale pushing the prices within the $0.43 to $0.49 levels.

2024-2025

In 2024-25, BTC halving would happen to push all crypto prices to the sky as in the past. Having said that, Skale could go as high as $0.73 to $1.33.

Only 4,000 winners were selected via a random draw.

The success of the NFT sale sparked huge demand on the secondary market, resulting in Chumbi Valley becoming the No. 1 Polygon NFT project on “Opensea Top NFTs.” The Chumbi Valley official collection reached over 1,000 ETH of volume in just seven days, with the pods holding a floor price of five times their original purchase price.

CHMB token launch and KuCoin IEO Spotlight

The team worked tirelessly throughout December to achieve a remarkable series of accomplishments.

What’s next for Chumbi Valley?

The Chumbi Valley community and Seed Chumbi NFT holders are excited for the Seed Chumbi Hatching Event that will be held on Jan. 20. Collectors and Chumbi fans are eager to catch a first glimpse of the 4,096 highly unique Seed Chumbi NFT designs.

January will hold many surprises as the team announces new partnerships, game dev progress, CHMB related activities and events.

2022-02-18,iZUMi Finance Launches DAO with veNFT Governance Based on ... - Crypto Briefing,"Share this article URL Copied

Rather than governance being based on quantity of tokens held in a wallet, this DAO will be governed based on number of tokens held in a veiZi NFT.

Programmable Liquidity Mining

izumi Finance , the innovative protocol that provides programmable liquidity mining on Uniswap V3, today announced the widely anticipated launch of its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO will be governed in a revolutionary way, with a quadratic voting mechanism based on veNFT.

The new iZUMi DAO veNFT (veiZi) governance token will enable DAO governance through quadratic voting on key issues for the community.

veiZi NFT compatible with the ERC271 standard and is designed to fully represent the governance rights of the iZUMi Finance protocol, which include voting, boosting and returning staking rewards. veNFT’s are a major step forward for the industry in terms of NFT utilization. Whereas in most DAOs, governance votes are represented by the number of tokens held in a wallet, iZUMi DAO governance votes are represented by the number of tokens held within a veiZi NFT.

iZUMi intends to adopt a DAO governance model with quadratic voting used to determine how the project will proceed on key issues. Each cycle’s iZi emissions will be determined and allocated according to the outcome of veNFT voting. For staking rewards, 50% of the platform’s revenue will be used to buy back iZi, which will be allocated to veiZi NFTs according to voting power. With NFTs staked, veiZi will be used to boost iZUMi i’s farming pool APR by up to 2.5 times.

veiZi NFTs can be minted by any iZUMi wallet address by locking iZi tokens for a certain period of time. It will also be possible to acquire veiZi through third-party NFT marketplaces.

veiZi are unique in that they are interest-bearing NFTs, allowing holders to stake them for rewards every month. Each iZUMi wallet will be able to stake a single veiZi NFT, with extensions of both the locked period and locked number available at any time. Unstaking is also possible at any time after a user collects their rewards. However, those farming rewards may be reduced if veiZi is unstaked before the rewards are claimed, due to the cancelation of boosting. Users can then redeem their veiZi and get back their locked iZi tokens after the locked time has been reached.

The introduction of veiZi aims to benefit the community in a number of ways, firstly by reducing the circulation of iZi in the secondary market, thus boosting the iZi token’s value. Second, veiZi is uniquely an interest-bearing NFT, enabling holders to earn staking rewards every month. Third, veiZi can be staked once and used an unlimited number of times to boost farming pools. Fourth, there’s minimized danger of losing liquidity in locked iZi, as veiZi can be traded on mainstream NFT markets such as OpenSea.

iZUMi i Finance is the platform providing programmable liquidity as a service on Uniswap V3 multi-chains. It proposes LiquidBox liquidity mining platform to provide Uniswap V3 LP token staking rewards non-homogeneously in different price ranges, which could improve the efficiency of incentive distribution for reward providers and enhance the earnings of liquidity providers in Uniswap V3. In addition, iZUMi will extend liquidity service to multi-chains with built-in DEX and bridge in the future.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvYnJpZWZpbmcuY29tL2l6dW1pLWZpbmFuY2UtbGF1bmNoZXMtcmV2b2x1dGlvbmFyeS1kYW8td2l0aC12ZW5mdC1nb3Zlcm5hbmNlLWJhc2VkLXF1YWRyYXRpYy12b3Rpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-02-25,NFT South conference scheduled for July 28 to 30 - Cointelegraph,"Dallas, TX, Feb. 22, 2022 — NFTs were hot in 2021, and will be even more so this year and beyond. Scheduled for July 28 to 30, 2022 in Dallas, Texas, NFT South is a conference where enthusiasts can meet to explore and celebrate the different use cases of NFTs.

The use cases for nonfungible tokens are increasing by the day, from generative arts and in-game assets to virtual worlds, events ticketing, membership cards, vehicle certification and more. Startups from far and wide will be at NFT South to showcase how they intend to disrupt (or are already disrupting) entire industries with NFT offerings. To demonstrate a particular use case of NFTs as sports memorabilia, a few attendees will get a chance to play chess one-on-one or in a simulation with the youngest grandmaster in chess history. Media from the games will be minted as NFTs and sold to the highest bidder, becoming valuable sport collectibles.

NFT South is a fully in-person event, particularly ideal for those who are tired of virtual events and want to mingle as before.

Attendees can register using a traditional ticketing platform or via NFT ticketing platforms Eventbrite, GUTS tickets and TKETS, and keep up to date via NFT South’s Twitter account. It’s going to be a fun event!

2022-01-12,Top 5 Metaverse Coins Below $1 to Watch in 2022 - Yahoo Finance,"One of the hottest trends in the cryptocurrency space last year was the metaverse. Numerous projects focusing on the metaverse emerged last year and grabbed the attention of investors.

However, 2022 will see more metaverse projects grab the headlines, thanks to the developments they have in store.

This post explores the top five metaverse coins below $1 to watch this year. We will look at what the projects are developing and why you should keep an eye on them.

What is the Metaverse?

The metaverse can best be described as a persistent, online, 3D universe comprising multiple virtual spaces. It is considered by many as a future iteration of the internet as it will allow users to meet, work, game, and socialize in the 3D spaces.

The metaverse is driven by augmented reality, with the user controlling a character or an avatar. With the metaverse, you can conduct your work meetings virtually and feel like you were physically present.

You can also do a wide range of things, including playing blockchain-based games and many more. Cryptocurrencies have become very important to the metaverse space. Cryptos serve as utility tokens in the metaverse, while the nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are the virtual collectibles.

Top Five Metaverse Coins Below $1

The metaverse is still in its early days, but numerous cryptocurrency projects are now focusing their attention on this space. Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Axie Infinity are some of the leading names in the metaverse space. However, we have some projects that are relatively unknown but have huge potential. Here are the top five metaverse coins that are currently trading below $1.

Bloktopia (BLOK)

Bloktopia is a decentralized metaverse built and backed by Polygon, one of the leading blockchains in the world. Bloktopia aims to provide an unprecedented VR experience for the crypto community, bringing users together all in one immersive and engaging environment.

It is one of the must-watch metaverse projects in 2022 because of its strong backing. Bloktopia has attracted investors such as Animoca Brands. Leading crypto companies including KuCoin, CoinMarketCap, and Coingecko already have their virtual offices within Bloktopia.

Story continues

Similar to other leading metaverse projects, Bloktopia offers a marketplace that allows users to buy BLOK real estate using an NFT mechanism.

BLOK is currently trading at $0.04265299, down by more than 74% from the all-time high of $0.178281 it achieved on October 31, 2021. Despite its recent decline, BLOK is still up by more than 450% from its all-time low of $0.00757922. BLOK has a market cap of $353 million.

Meta Hero (HERO)

Meta Hero describes itself as the gateway to the metaverse. The project intends to use Ultra-HD photogrammetric scanning technology to bring on the next 10 million new users to cryptocurrency.

Meta Hero partnered with Wolf Studio, a leader in the 3D scanning world, to work on its project. The team’s introduction of meta scanners in the metaverse creates numerous use cases like 3D printing, scanning network and in-game character creation.

The Meta Hero team has already launched its 4K HD scanners but is currently working on upgrading to 16K Ultra-HD. HERO is currently trading at $0.111673, down by 55% from the all-time high of $0.252021 it achieved on December 2, 2021.

Despite its recent bearish performance, HERO is up by more than 1,900% from the all-time low price of $0.00537031. HERO has a market cap of $572 million.

Epik Prime (EPIK)

EPIK Prime is an NFT platform working with AAA gaming companies and giant entertainment IP and brands to create in-game NFT goods and marketplaces. Epik differs from the other projects on this list because it helps businesses license and produce NFTs and immersive blockchain-powered in-game experiences.

The EPIK Prime team is considered one of the industry leaders in terms of empowering early-stage blockchain games. It helps these projects gain mainstream adoption.

EPIK is currently trading at $0.282311, down by 67% from its all-time high of $0.865706, which was attained on November 17, 2021. However, EPIK is up by more than 230% from its all-time low price of $0.085736. EPIK’s current market cap is around $66 million.

Star Atlas (Atlas)

Star Atlas is regarded as one of the gems in the metaverse space. It is a Solana-powered metaverse game with a dual token economy.

The team seeks to combine blockchain, real-time graphics, multiplayer video games, and decentralized financial technologies to ensure that its game is one of the best in the cryptocurrency space.

Star Atlas is still in its early stages, but the community is excited about this project. The roadmap indicates that the team is working on something unique, and the trailer available on their website also gives users something to be excited about.

ATLAS is trading at $0.087497, down by more than 60% from the all-time high price of $0.267549 attained on September 4, 2021. The cryptocurrency is only up by 38% from its all-time low of $0.063366 and has a market cap of around $190 million.

RedFox (RFOX)

RFOX was developed by RedFox Labs, a tech company that is currently building a virtual space for retail purposes. The team wants RFOX to be the global leader in immersive metaverse experiences focused on retail, media, gaming, and rewards.

The project works on a dual token system, where RFOX tokens are used for buying land and virtual assets, while the VFOX is the reward token of the ecosystem. RFOX is a metaverse project to watch in 2022 because the team is not done building.

The team is currently developing numerous products, including RFOX Finance and RFOX Games. These products are designed to complement the final metaverse.

RFOX is trading at $0.080576, down by 78% from its all-time high of $0.377778. However, it is still up by nearly 600% from the all-time low price of $0.01152142. RFOX has a market cap of $115 million.

Conclusion

The metaverse is a fast-growing area within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. There are numerous projects within the metaverse space, but the above-discussed coins are worth watching out for in 2022.

2022-01-12,Next Generation MEME Token About to go Public! NEXT SHIB to Launch on Multiple Blockchains. - CoinCodex,"It’s cute, it’s deflationary, it’s NEXT SHIB!

DeFi’s newest cutest meme token announces the launch of its public sale. The mascot of the new, ultra-fast ultra-cheap NEXT Smart Chain has arrived.

Deflationary on every transaction (5%) and with no other tax , no team tokens , and starting with a very low market cap , this meme token is lifting off to visit it’s Nextronaught NFT siblings in orbit (#Nextronaughts are coming down to play in the #Nextverse very soon!).

In recent years meme tokens have emerged to become more popular than many mainstream cryptocurrencies, thanks to their unique mass appeal. NEXT SHIB is the newest entrant into the meme coin space so far ruled by DOGE and Shiba Inu. The tokenomics and the underlying operations of NEXT SHIB, however, differ vastly from the rest of the meme coins, powering NEXT SHIB with rocket fuel. The token follows a deflationary model where the total supply of 100 billion tokens deflates every time a transfer is made, but with no other reservation of tokens for any purpose other than to permanently lock its liquidity (yes permanently! ). It also has a low initial market cap of less than $500K.

This ensures a steady growth in value and wealth accumulation possibility for early adopters. The private presale was a success and the public sale opened today, until the end of January. NEXT SHIB token is available on the Ethereum Network (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and on its own native NEXT Smart Chain (NSC).

The Blockchain Built for Scalability

The NEXT Smart Chain is a third-generation blockchain network that has clear advantages over Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. With a clever combination of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) technologies, the network manages to achieve a speed of 300000 transactions per second (yes 300K tps ) and a persistently low transaction cost of circa $0.0001 per transaction - the lowest fees in the current market.

NEXT Smart Chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so all ERC-20 tokens and decentralized applications can function on the NEXT Smart Chain (yes – all DAPPS will just work). Just like NEXT SHIB, the NEXT Smart Chain (ticker: NEXT) has a very low market cap of less than $1 million and a fixed token supply of 30.3 million NEXT, while its competitors reach over $1 billion in market cap.

The unmatched scalability and transaction speeds offered on this blockchain make it the ideal network to deploy the next generation of NFT and NEXT Metaverse projects. With NFT gaming and trading within the Metaverse becoming the highly anticipated products of Web3, projects using NEXT Smart Chain will be poised to uniquely benefit from its robust underlying architecture to provide a healthy user experience to early adopters. The smart chain will launch with over 200 independent validators, making it a very decentralized and secure blockchain.

With the launch of the NEXT SHIB once the public sale completes, NEXT Smart Chain will transform the market as a centre of excellence for metaverse innovations & crypto projects.

The future is bright – come and see what’s NEXT!!

2022-02-06,What Is Enjin? - Cryptosrus,"Enjin is an exciting play-to-earn metaverse project. Learn more about it in our “What Is Enjin?” guide.

Concerns

WHAT IS ENJIN CRYPTO?

Enjin is a blockchain-based software built on the Ethereum network. It enables developers to create and manage virtual goods, or items on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of ERC-1155 tokens. Enjin has brought the benefits of blockchain technology to gaming along with the benefits of smart contracts. Enjin allows the creation of in-game digital assets that are usable in multiple games. Each asset created through Enjin can be customized to suit the needs of the required platform. In this way, the developers can help gamers to avoid fraud, and create and transfer digital assets with minimum cost.

Enjin’s unique SDKs (Software Development Kits) allow the users to create and in turn integrate digital assets into different games and applications. Each asset that is minted is recorded on a smart contract. Thus, the items that are added to the blockchain will subsequently be recognized by any Enjin wallet. So the entire ecosystem is interlinked to enable the transfer of digital assets from anywhere on the platform.

WHO CREATED ENJIN?

Enjin was created in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski. Blagov is currently the CEO and Creative Director of the project. While Radomski is the Chief Technical Officer (CTO). Initially, it was launched as the Enjin Network, a community gaming platform. The Enjin network still exists to this day, providing users the ability to create apps, websites, and forums for gamers.

In 2017, Enjin transitioned into the blockchain space. It held its first ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and raised $18.9 million. In early 2018, Enjin released their own blockchain wallet known as the Enjin wallet. In the summer of the same year, Enjin launched the mainnet of its platform on the Ethereum network. Enjin also proposed a new token standard for Ethereum known as ERC-1155, which got approved in 2019 and is currently being used by the platform.

The company is based in Singapore and works on implementing smart digital solutions with other companies. It has collaborated with more than 250,000 gaming communities with almost 18.7 million registered gamers under its domain. Enjin also claims to have over 1 million downloads of its wallet, and more than 3000 projects being created on the Enjin platform.

HOW IT WORKS?

The main utility of Enjin is that it enables users to create, manage and store virtual goods for games. These can include unique in-game items like swords or other accessories for the characters. Enjin is a “Platform as a Service” or PaaS, which allows users to manage their in-game assets without the complexities generally involved. The digital assets created using Enjin are compatible with a whole host of games. This means that users can transfer their in-game NFTs, to multiple games.

To create or melt digital assets on Enjin, the developers must follow 5 steps. These include;

ACQUISITION: First of all the developers need to buy ENJ tokens. It is necessary to have ENJ tokens, to mint digital assets on the platform.

MINTING: Digital assets on the platform are designed and minted by the developers using their ENJ tokens. Each digital asset that is minted, takes a certain amount of ENJ token, and locks it away, taking it out of circulation.

GAMING: The minted digital tokens are in the form of ERC-1155 tokens. These Tokens are acquired by the players and can be used across multiple games for various purposes and functionalities.

TRADING: These digital assets or tokens can be traded amongst the players as well.

MELTING: These tokens can be melted, and the amount of ENJ tokens used to create the asset can be recovered. Furthermore, Tokens can also be sold for ENJ by the players.

Enjin also employs the use of many different Software Development Kits (SDKs) for proper functionalities which include wallets and payment platforms. Furthermore, Enjin has also created APIS (Application Programming Interfaces) to help integrate the digital assets, and items in-game.

The ERC-1155 token standard, which is the token standard used by Enjin for its digital assets, allows up to 100 assets to be sent simultaneously. This helps in minimizing the congestion on the Ethereum Network. Similarly, Enjin has also introduced Ethereum Name Services (ENS) support, allowing users to have “human-readable addresses”. This saves users from the trouble of lengthy, cryptographic wallet addresses.

Enjin also has its own native wallet where digital assets and items can be stored by the players. The hardware of the wallet uses an Advanced Encryption Standard, while its software is customized to encrypt the data processed by the wallet. It has been created in a security-centric way. Its unique keyboard restricts keyloggers from seeing what has been typed by the user, whether it is the password or any private keys. The keyboard can also be customized by the users. A DApp browser was also released by Enjin for its wallet in 2019 which enables users to complete their transactions with one click.

WHAT IS ENJ TOKEN?

Enjin Coin (ENJ) is the native token of the Enjin platform. It is an ERC-20 token. The total supply of ENJ is 1 billion tokens, out of which more than 900 million are in circulation at the moment. ENJ is primarily used to create digital assets on the platform in the form of ERC-1155 tokens. ERC-1155 tokens are basically Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Basically what this means is that each token is unique and different from the rest. Unlike ERC-20 tokens which are fungible, which means that each token is the same, and interchangeable.

Whenever users create digital assets using ENJ, a certain amount of ENJ tokens are taken out of circulation. As of right now, more than 10 million ENJ tokens are out of circulation and locked away into digital assets. The owners of these assets can ‘melt’ their assets, and get ENJ tokens as a result. Users can also obtain ENJ by selling their assets. It can also be used as a currency for buying, selling, and trading NFTs. Although ENJ can’t be staked directly, several platforms acting as a third party, allow users to lock up their ENJ tokens.

CONCERNS

The NFT space saw a massive boom in 2021, it seems certain that it will continue well into 2022 and beyond. Many new NFT based gaming projects are taking the world by storm. Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and The Sandbox are just a few of the many projects whose primary selling point is NFTs. Enjin faces massive competition in this regard, and it needs to constantly innovate if it is to survive.

Similarly, Enjin also suffers from the limitations of Ethereum. The high congestion on Ethereum along with the astronomical transaction fees is sure to dissuade potential new users of Enjin. Until and unless Ethereum solves these problems through Ethereum 2.0, it will remain a genuine concern for Enjin. Some people also raise the concern that the crypto-wallet offered by Enjin is not open-source.

WHERE CAN I BUY ENJIN CRYPTO?

Enjin crypto can be purchased on major crypto exchanges like KuCoin, similar to how one would buy any other cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you’re willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your set limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current market price and have your order filled almost instantly. If you are interested in trading ENJ, you can do so by visiting KuCoin, Gate.io, and Binance.US.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1lbmppbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-01-28,"OMI Token Is Getting Ready To Breakout, Says Technical Analyst - Cryptosrus","Ecomi’s OMI token is showing some promising signs of a bullish breakout.

Covered:

OMI Token’s Recent Price Action

Charts (W,D,H)

What to Anticipate, Key Technical Levels & Indicators Used





OMI Token is Showing Signs of a Bullish Breakout

ECOMI (OMI) is a new crypto whose price dates only to March 2021. Its charts on different time frames suggest that this could have a breakout to the upside soon. Also, OMI’s market cap chart is singing the same song.

This is the market cap chart OMI.

In this volatile world of cryptos, it’s not every day you see a clean pattern on a crypto’s market cap.

Let’s dive into looking at different time frames of OMI to see what it has to offer.

OMI Token: Weekly

The weekly chart of OMI shows an uptrend that is beginning, and every test to 0.005 has been bought up.

The squeeze indicator shows a medium compression squeeze in the making.



OMI Token: Daily

The daily chart shows a big bull flag pattern.



Notice that the flag part of the pattern is shown in the box, and in this consolidation range, we can see an inverse head & shoulder pattern with two right shoulders. Sometimes head and shoulders patterns can have two shoulders on the right side.

The momentum oscillator shows that the fast momentum line (yellow) is pointing up while being above the midline and the slow momentum line (red). This is a very good example of bullish momentum using this indicator.

The squeeze indicator shows no squeeze, and the momentum is bullish but falling(Blue). However, if the lower time frames are bullish, this could go back to the most bullish histogram (Cyan), which is momentum rising and bullish.

OMI Token: Hourly

I don’t always show an hourly chart, but when I do, I’d prefer a great setup. The one-hour chart of OMI shows a very clean pattern of “Cup & Handle.”

When we look at the daily chart, it shows a clean pattern of a bull flag. Inside that bull flag, we saw an inverse head and shoulder pattern, and now zooming in further, we see a cup & handle pattern in the hourly chart.

The momentum oscillator shows its momentum is rising and bullish with the fast momentum line (Yellow) above the midline and the slow momentum line (Red). The squeeze indicator shows a low-compression squeeze, and it could fire soon.

In summary, we have a combination of 3 bullish patterns on different time frames with rising momentum. This one is a good one to keep an eye on.

2022-01-25,Elon Musk Implores McDonald's To Adopt Dogecoin - Cryptosrus,"When Elon Musk asks for things, they typically happen. The Tesla CEO and Dogecoin father pleaded with McDonald’s to offer Dogecoin as a payment option via Twitter today.

Elon Musk Wants McDonald’s To Accept Dogecoin

The self-proclaimed Dogecoin father and CEO of Tesla Elon Musk is out to help the Dogecoin community again. On Tuesday, he tweeted that he would eat a Happy Meal on TV if Mcdonald’s allows customers to pay with Dogecoin.

I will eat a happy meal on tv if @McDonalds accepts Dogecoin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2022

After just a few hours, Musk’s tweet received over 200k likes. Per usual, Dogecoin spiked around 8% in FIVE minutes, yes five minutes, before it started to head back down. $DOGE has since leveled off but still remains in the green for the day at the time of press.

In the above chart, the curser is placed at about the exact time Elon tweeted his plead for McDonald’s to accept $DOGE.

Musk’s tweet comes a day after McDonald’s began interacting with the crypto community on twitter. The fast food giant tweeted: “how are you doing people who run crypto twitter accounts”. during the sharp sell off of the entire crypto market on Monday.

Dogecoin Community Urges McDonald’s

Let’s be clear, Elon’s tweet was not random. Over the past week, the Dogecoin community has been all over McDonald’s to accept $DOGE. The idea is to get enough people to urge McDonald’s to accept Dogecoin and it will actually happen. McDonald’s is listening:

We appreciate hearing your interest and continuously evaluate the payments experience. — McDonald's (@McDonalds) January 20, 2022

To go back further, it all started earlier in the week when McDonald’s tweeted a picture of french fries and asked their followers to respond with a photoshopped image of anyone snagging a fry. The co-founder of Dogecoin, Billy Markus, accepted that challenge and responded with a picture of the Shiba Inu mascot of Dogecoin eating a fry.

hey #dogecoin fam let’s make sure this tweet response of McDonald’s is their highest engagement one https://t.co/9nZPRy8p53 — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) January 19, 2022

It would not be surprising if McDonald’s actually makes this happen. From a corporate level, McDonald’s probably sees this as a giant untapped reservoir of potential customers.

StockX NFTs

What This Means For NFTs

StockX NFTs

Another large company is making its way into crypto, and this time, physical products will be tied to the NFT’s creating a whole new way to trade. The announcement, which was unveiled today, “uses non-fungible tokens tied to physical products that sneaker traders can buy and sell instantly using blockchain technology to ensure authenticity.“

Each ‘Vault NFT’ “is an ownable digital token, backed by the same physical item held in StockX’s new secure vault.” These NFT’s will be inexpensive to trade according to StockX: “no shipping fees, low transaction fees, no crypto required, and no closet space needed.”

As you can see in the below image, users have the ability to sell the NFT, which is backed by a real pair of shoes, or, redeem it for the real pair, stored in the vault. “Buyers will own the token and the corresponding sneakers and may have them delivered at any time.”

The CEO of StockX Scott Cutler said that the move into NFTs helps immensely with the traceability and authenticity of the shoes, something that NFTs can help streamline. Moreover, you can actually own the shoes, without actually owning them. Allowing users to amass a digital collection of shoes that are backed by the real thing.

It also allows users to “speculate” on the shoes and trade them far easier than ever before. As StockX says: “If you’re bullish on a shoe, consider investing in a Vault NFT. You take possession of the NFT immediately after the transaction is complete, meaning it is the fastest way to flip.”

What This Means For NFTs

In many ways, it opens up the capital in this highly-traded resale market to become far more efficient. Users can trade the sneakers without ever owning them. According to images on the website, StockX will be using Ethereum, but it is unclear if a Layer-2 will be involved.

According to their roadmap, StockX is planning on branching out into personal wallet withdrawals, crypto payments, and crypto payouts. This should be a boon for the company, as they are seeking to go public. In April, the company said it was valued at $3.8 billion after “a secondary tender offering.”

JP Morgan Flips On The Metaverse

Metaverse Momentum Heading Into 2022

Many people love the idea of the metaverse; many others want to puke at the sound of it. Historically, when a good idea catches fire, there tends to be a lot of naysayers trying to put out the flame. But if true value arises from innovation, the haters always go quiet. JP Morgan, one of the largest banks in the world ($3.9 trillion AUM), looks to be the latest metaverse skeptic that’s starting to see the light.

JP Morgan Flips On The Metaverse

It’s not just virtual reality that physical banks like JP Morgan are having a hard time coping with, it’s the crypto asset class in general.

It wasn’t that long ago that JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon was expressing his own doubts about Bitcoin — it was last month. Most recently, the Wall Street executive partook in an interview in January 2022 with Kathimerini, a Greek financial and political news daily, in which he expressed his personal feelings on crypto “currencies.”

“I don’t call them cryptocurrencies, I call them crypto-tokens, because currencies have rules of law behind them, central banks and tax authorities.

Despite his lack of understanding, the bank’s decisions are is not entirely his own, and JP Morgan has been pushing harder into the crypto space. Specifically, the financial giant is eyeing the metaverse, claiming that it’s a “$1 trillion per year market opportunity.” They’ve even opened their own “Onyx Lounge” inside Decentraland.

Metaverse Momentum Heading Into 2022

It’s not just JP Morgan that sees massive opportunity in the metaverse; other banks, companies, and even countries are wanting to get involved with the action.

Just today, the infamous Playboy announced that it would be bringing the iconic Playboy Mansion to the metaverse. So far in 2022, Mcdonald’s revealed some of the NFT trademarks it’s been filing for behind the scenes. A report from Walmart showed that the retailer has multiple trademark applications for online retail and ‘virtual merchandise.’ The Australian Open tapped into Decentraland to bring its famous tennis tournament to the virtual space.

The point is: nearly every industry you can think of, whether it’s food, retail, sports, or sex, is entering the metaverse. The only other network I can think of that taps into so many different industries is the internet itself.

Bank of America: The metaverse is now like social media in its beginning — Blockworks (@Blockworks_) February 14, 2022

While there are many metaverse projects on the market, Decentraland (MANA) and Sandbox (SAND) are the two clear frontrunners when it comes to mainstream metaverse adoption.

However, as noted by other Bank Of America, there’s no telling whether Decentraland or Sandbox will be able to keep hold of the metaverse market. Like Facebook’s overtaking of MySpace, these platforms could prove to suffer a similar fate. The reality is the metaverse will likely arise in a similar fashion to the internet — with contributions all around the globe as we build a singular virtual layer to interact on. We’ve already laid the foundation with the internet and social media; the metaverse will simply be a “physical” layer to take us beyond staring at 2D computer screens.

Bank of America and JP Morgan are starting to see the vision, are you?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vdGhpcy1pcy13aGVyZS1qcC1tb3JnYW4tdGhpbmtzLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2UtaXMtZ29pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Concerns

WHAT IS MONERO?

The majority of the blockchain networks in use today are transparent. What this means is that the identities of the users can easily be traced, because the wallet addresses are visible for all to see in their public ledger. Take the example of Bitcoin. Even though the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are anonymous but still both the sender and receiver have their wallet addresses permanently visible on the Bitcoin public ledger. This process limits the privacy to pseudo-anonymity.

This privacy concern led to the rise of privacy coins. These privacy coins are desired by those who are seeking true financial confidentiality. Out of all the privacy coins launched, Monero is the one that stands out. Monero means “money” or “coin” in Esperanto. It is a cryptocurrency that has been tailor-made to keep transactions and wallet addresses completely anonymous. Monero keeps the transactions private and doesn’t reveal either the source or destination of funds. It employs a number of techniques that make it impossible to trace how the money is spent. Due to its many features regarding privacy and anonymity, it has become one of the most extensively used cryptocurrencies on the Dark web.

WHO CREATED MONERO?

The creators of Monero chose to remain anonymous. They chose to use pseudonyms instead. Initially, Monero was created as a hardfork of ByteCoin. The creation of Monero or BitMonero as it was known then is attributed to a user named “thankful_for_today”. However, BitMonero was, later on, forked into a new project named simply as Monero. Seven of the original community members of BitMonero became the core team of Monero, and they were led by “Fluffpony”.

Monero developers intended to develop a currency in which the coins couldn’t be affected by their past usage. This is called fungibility and this quality has become a major selling point for privacy coins. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum don’t have this quality, as each token in their network has its own history of how and when it was used.

HOW IT WORKS?

The Monero blockchain employs the use of a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm which is called RandomX. It has been specifically designed to advance CPU mining which is considered resource-efficient and much more accessible than ASIC mining. Thus, its mining is user and environment-friendly. Monero’s primary focus is on privacy and that’s why it incorporates total privacy. This means that all transactions are absolutely private and can’t be traced. It involves certain aspects to attain total privacy.

There are three distinct features that make Monero private.

Ring Signature

Multiple Keys

Stealth addresses

RING SIGNATURES

A ring signature is a digital signature that is used by a member of a specified group who secretly signs a document making it impossible to tell where this signature came from but the authenticity of the signature can be easily verified. This technique is in work every time a transaction is carried out. During the process of a transaction, the Monero wallet forms a ring by pulling other users’ keys from the blockchain. As a result, it appears that the transaction could have been signed by anyone in the ring. Similarly, the transactions which are made through the Ring signature and are ultra-private are called Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCTs). RingCTs hide the transaction amount and reveal them only to the recipient.

MULTIPLE KEYS

Three types of keys are used by Monero.

A View Key

A Private send key

A Public address

As the names indicate, a View key is used to view the sort of transaction that the user has made. A Private Spend Key is used for sending payments and a Public Address Key is used for receiving payments.

STEALTH ADDRESSES

Stealth addresses are used to hide the destination of funds. It is done by allowing the sender to generate a one-time address that is based on his public address. This address will only be used for that specific transaction. While searching an address in a Monero block explorer, one can’t match any transaction in it because of these stealth addresses. Every transaction is done on a new address and no two addresses are the same.

Because of all its unique features, Monero is;

Scalable: It allows a large number of transactions when needed.

Fungible: Its currency has no identifying mark means that its currency has no traceable history.

Multiple Keys: An additional layer of keys is used that allows the network to hide when and how a currency is used.

WHAT XMR?

XMR is the native currency of the Monero network. XMR can be used for anonymous peer-to-peer transactions. Using XMR ensures that the sender and the receiver are both kept anonymous and untraceable. It is also used to pay for the transaction fees. XMR is also unique because of the fact that it is truly a fungible currency. This means that each token is exactly the same when it comes to privacy and anonymity. To explain it in simpler terms let’s take the example of a $1 bill. Each bill has its own serial number, hence its circulation can be tracked, and traced. In the case of XMR, the history of each token is untraceable.

XMR is not like a traditional deflationary currency in the sense that it doesn’t have any fixed total supply. However, it has its own method of achieving scarcity through a gradual decrease in its issuance. This means that the issuance of new XMR tokens will diminish over time until it reaches just 0.6 XMR per block.

CONCERNS

The primary concern of Monero actually stems from its biggest strength. Although its anonymous transactions and untraceability make it a big hit among privacy-centric users, it also opens the door for a lot of illegal activity. Monero is widely being used on the dark web, for the purchase of drugs, and weapons. Since it can’t be traced, therefore it has become an ideal currency for those who want to indulge in any illegal transaction.

Although the mining of XMR was designed in such a way, so as to avoid centralization, or the accumulation of too much mining power into the hands of a few individuals, so far this model has failed. This is because more than 43% of the total hash rate is accumulated in just 3 mining pools, making the mining of XMR extremely centralized.

Where To Buy XMR?

You can purchase XMR through KuCoin exchange, similar to buying another cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you are willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current price and have your order filled almost immediately. If you are interested in purchasing XMR, you can do so by visiting KuCoin or Gate.io.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1tb25lcm8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-02-10,DeFi Project Dego Finance Hacked: Exploiters Reportedly Drain Over $10M - CryptoPotato,"Dego Finance was hacked on February 10. Shortly after, it joined forces with prominent cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Kucoin, and Gate.io to close deposits of its native governance and equity token, DEGO. The protocol also urged Uniswap, Poloniex, PancakeSwap, WazirX, etc., to do the same to mitigate the losses.

Dego Finance Hackers Withdraw $10M

Dego Finance’s official Twitter handle claimed that its own address providing liquidity on popular decentralized exchanges – Uniswap and PancakeSwap – was compromised. As a result, DEGO pairs liquidity provided by the team was drained.

The DeFi platform also urged the hackers to come forward and communicate with it.

“We’ll keep all stakeholders updated on the latest developments, as well as talk to reputable security teams on how to identify the hacker and retrieve loss. We would ask the hacker to come forward and communicate.”

According to the blockchain security and analytics company Peckshield, the exploiters withdrew more than $10 billion from Dego Finance as well as from GameFi Incubator Cocos-BCX. The company’s data showed that funds from 13 addresses were drained, which belonged to Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Cronos.

DEGO Takes Nearly 20% Plunge

Dego Finance’s token, DEGO took a severe beating following the hack. It slumped by almost 20% from $4.50 to $3.65 in the wee hours of Thursday morning.

For the uninitiated, Dego Finance saw the light of day in 2020 and offered both DeFi and NFT tools. It claimed to be an open-NFT ecosystem that allowed users to mint non-fungible tokens initiate NFT mining in addition to auctions and trading.

It also offers a cross-chain infrastructure to facilitate blockchain ventures to ramp up the user base, distribute tokens, as well as develop more diverse NFT-based apps. In March 2021, Binance announced listing the project in the Innovation Zone.

Rug pulls and hacks have continued to wreak havoc in the DeFi space in recent years. 2021 has been a monumental year for DeFi and an equally monumental year for bad actors in the space. In fact, rug pulls accounted for 37% of all scam revenue last year as opposed to just 1% in 2020. This year as well, little has changed as such events continue to grab headlines.

2022-01-27,HITCO-backed fan funding firm Corite raises $6.2m in private token ... - Music Business Worldwide,"Sweden-born fan funding platform Corite has raised $6.2 million in a private $CO token sale for its blockchain-based sister project, Corite CO.

The round saw participation from significant music and crypto players such as ChromaWay, Kyros Ventures, Kucoin and existing backer Charles Goldstuck.

The new Corite CO platform will allow $CO token holders to participate in blockchain fan funding and promotion, get early access to invest in music projects, in addition to earning rewards for “contributing and participating in the governance of the Corite ecosystem”, according to a media release.

The firm is preparing to launch the first version of the CO Fan Power blockchain platform in Q1 2022.

Corite, which inked a partnership with L.A-based HITCO Entertainment in May 2021, enables fans to directly invest in their favorite artists, and to earn a proportion of said artists’ streaming royalties in return.

HITCO, run by L.A Reid and Charles Goldstuck, acquired a minority stake in Corite as part of the partnership, which saw the platform expand into the US.

Co-founded by Universal Music Sweden alumni Mattias Tengblad (CEO) and Emil Angervall (COO), Corite was launched in Sweden in 2019 and has also since expanded to Europe.

The company says that thousands of backers have signed up to become active stakeholders in their favorite artists through the platform.

Corite CO was created in collaboration with ChromaWay, Corite’s key partner and investor that offers a distributed ledger technology (DLT) and decentralized finance infrastructure via its Chromia ecosystem.

According to Corite, the Corite CO platform leverages the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model “to give artists full control over their content, and access to new models of interacting with their fans through NFTs, digital merchandise, and tokens”.

In November of 2021, Corite CO launched its first NFT campaign in Times Square, featuring Emery Kelly’s “Emotions” collection of non-fungibles.

According to Corite, the Corite CO project has secured funding from a global network of prominent venture capital firms operating in the music industry and the cryptocurrency space.

The list of crypto investors includes Kucoin labs, Gate labs, MEXC, Shima Capital, Rarestone Capital, Kyros Ventures, Titans Ventures, Coin98, Innovion, Everse Capital, ZBS Capital, Parachain Ventures, Oig Capital, Dawnstar Capital along with many others.

Also in January 2022, Corite announced its strategic partnership with 4000 Studios, one of Australia’s largest music studio complexes.

“Corite is uniquely positioned to help lead the music industry into the music/web3 world.” Charles Goldstuck

Charles Goldstuck, Corite Investor and Founder and Co-Chairman of HITCO, said: “Corite is uniquely positioned to help lead the music industry into the music/web3 world.

“The groundwork that has been done by the team sets the stage for moving this offering into primetime.”

Emelie Olsson, Director of Artist Relations at Corite, added: ”With platforms like TikTok completely changing the music industry in a very short amount of time, we’re seeing a growing trend where the power of fans and communities becomes the very core of being a successful artist today.

“We will be able to support all aspects of that ecosystem.”

“During 2022, we will scale to help artists and fans across the globe to join forces, using their fan power to the max.” Mattias Tengblad, Corite

Mattias Tengblad, Co-founder and CEO, said: “NFTs and blockchain technology continues to explode within the music industry. With our unique product, global community and strong financials we are now in a great position.

2022-01-19,"Bitcoin Mining Energy Use 'Inconsequential,' 'Rapidly Becoming ... - Cryptonews","Bitcoin Mining Energy Use ‘Inconsequential,’ ‘Rapidly Becoming More Efficient’ - Saylor

MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor. Source: a screenshot, Youtube/Swan Signal - A Bitcoin Channel

The total use of energy for Bitcoin (BTC) mining is “inconsequential,” and it is “rapidly becoming more efficient,” MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said, as the mining industry is preparing for a hearing in the US House of Representatives this week.

Saylor was speaking during a quarterly briefing by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) on Wednesday.

According to the CEO, the amount of energy Bitcoin is using makes up no more than “a rounding error” in other major industries, and is “negligible” when compared to total world energy usage.

“Relative to the world-wide energy usage, [bitcoin] uses about 14 basis points,” Saylor said, noting that this is up over the past quarter given that Bitcoin’s hashrate, or the computational power, has “increased dramatically.”

7-day moving average. Source: bitinfocharts.com

Further, the prominent Bitcoin bull said that mining is not only very efficient in its current state, but stressed that it also keeps getting more efficient over time.

“It’s already the most cost-efficient major industrial user of energy in the world, it’s extraordinary in its efficiency,” Saylor said, adding that “the important point is it’s getting more efficient.”

In addition to Saylor, Coin Metrics co-founder and Castle Island Ventures general partner Nic Carter also joined the briefing. In his remarks, Carter focused on the recently published misleading memo prepared for an upcoming hearing in the US House of Representatives on the impact of crypto mining, saying the memo contains figures relating to e-waste from mining that “we know to be false.”

“The claim is that Bitcoin mining generated 30,000 metric tons of e-waste in 2021,” Carter said, adding that this is based on a paper that assumes a 1.29-year depreciation cycle for ASIC Bitcoin mining machines.

“[Bitmain’s S9 mining machines] represent 25% of the network hashrate, and that was an ASIC released in 2016,” Carter said, explaining that most mining firms use depreciation assumptions that are “much longer” than 1.29 years.

“We’ve seen in practice that ASICs generally have lasted far longer than most people expected,” Carter said, adding that the depreciation cycle nowadays “is probably more like 5 years effectively.”

Also, per data compiled by the Bitcoin Mining Council last month, global BTC mining consumes 3.2% of the electrical system energy wasted or lost in the USA in the space of a year. They also claim that Bitcoin mining energy use is 0.142% when compared to the world's total energy.

Furthermore, per this data, almost 59% of global BTC miners now use sustainable power – compared to nations like Brazil, which uses just over 2% renewable electricity. The USA uses less than 32%, while the EU figure is almost 44%.

Additionally, the council added, BTC mining technology has come on in leaps and bounds, meaning that miners working today are now 5,814% more efficient than those working just eight years ago.

Intel inside Bitcoin mining

During the online discussion, Michael Saylor also touched on the recent news that the major American chipmaker Intel might launch a new type of Bitcoin mining machine with greatly improved energy efficiency.

According to the CEO, Intel’s entry into the space has the potential to accelerate the energy efficiency of Bitcoin mining, calling it “indicative of the vitality of the network and a good thing overall.”

The new chip, which has been described as an “ultra-low-voltage energy-efficient Bitcoin mining ASIC,” is rumored to be unveiled during a company presentation on February 23, Cryptonews.com reported yesterday.

2022-02-03,Stop Guessing: How Small Retail Crypto Traders Are Using Automated Grid-Bot Trading Strategies To Gain Profits And An Edge - Moguldom,"Small retail traders are using automated grid-bot trading strategies to help them profit from the ups and downs of crypto price fluctuations and gain an edge over manual traders.

A grid bot is an automated trading algorithm that helps carry out the grid trading strategy. It schedules or sets up buy and sell orders in a predefined price range, creating a grid-like formation.

The algorithm allows small retail traders to place a string of purchase and sell orders within a given price range. Once a sale order is fully executed, the bot instantly places another purchase order at a lower grid level, and vice versa.

Grid trading is mostly associated with the foreign exchange market.

It works well in a competitive market with regular price variations and is best used while there is no clear-up or downtrend for a longer period. The more frequent and bigger the price fluctuations are, the more profitable the strategy will be.

To begin, one needs to choose a price range for the strategy and then decide how many “grids” should be inside. The price range is basically split into multiple smaller ranges (grids) to increase the likelihood of trades to trigger.

More grids increase the trading frequency because the grid width is decreased, but at the same time, the profit earned with each order will decrease. Traders must choose between many trades which earn only a small profit at a time, or a few trades that make a big profit each time.

An advantage of grid trading is that it requires little forecasting of market direction and can be easily automated.

Grid trading is a reliable strategy in the crypto market. It is a proven, time-tested, and profitable trading strategy. There are many examples of successful traders actively using it over decades on all kinds of markets.

Due to its high fluctuations, the crypto market, in particular, turned out to be one of the most reliable spaces for grid trading strategies.

An automated trading system allows traders to establish specific rules from both trade entries and exits, that, once programmed, can be automatically executed through a computer. Automated trading systems are also known as algorithmic trading.

BOTS is constantly expanding… also to regions that have different #currencies.

Crypto trading relies on algorithms — a set of instructions used to solve a computational “problem”, like the way social media uses algorithms to tweak user feed to their preferences.

Trading bots use application programming interfaces (APIs) — software intermediaries — that can allow different applications to communicate. These bots can use a trader’s account to carry out trades using the available assets.

Using the grid trading bot helps a trader to avoid emotional decisions and to lock up small profits all the time, while the price keeps fluctuating. It makes it easy to gain a stable, passive profit with low risk in the volatile crypto market.

Before running a grid bot, find the best pairs and market circumstances and learn how to read the market, look through charts, and acquire a feeling of what to search for. Look for charts with a sideways or modest uptick, making sure that there are not any indications of a long-term downturn.

Here are some different types of trading bots:

1. KuCoin Trading Bot

KuCoin is a trading tool that allows users to gain passive income with automated trading strategies. It is built to be a zero-cost, time-saving, and simple-to-use trading tool for all classes of investors in a variety of market conditions, whether bullish, bearish, or volatile.

KuCoin celebrated the first anniversary of its trading bot product in January 2022. Since the launch, more than 5.5 million bots have been created and about $150 million in profit has been made by KuCoin users.

He talks about the risk factors for Bitcoin as an investment asset including origin risk, speculative market structure, regulatory, and environment. Are broader financial markets in a massive speculative bubble?

2. Pionex

Unlike other platforms, Pionex has the most advanced grid bot features including stop-loss, take profit, and trigger price. It offers five very advanced, modified versions of grid bots for free. All of them can be used for different kinds of market conditions and various situations.

The Pionex grid bot helps the user to catch volatilities in a ranging market (low volatility or flat vs. high volatility or up and down) by putting continuous buy and sell orders repetitively in a grid fashion.

This enables a trader to catch the market volatility inside a certain price range. The bot places buy and sell orders, which enables it to buy low and sell high for the user if the price fluctuates within the set price range.

On Pionex, there is the advantage of the “leveraged grid bot” or “margin grid bot”. These are special kinds of grid bots where traders can adjust the risk they are willing to take and multiply any profit or loss made by doing so.

3. Binance spot grid trading

Binance spot grid trading performs the best in volatile markets when prices fluctuate within a specific range. To use the Binance spot grid trading strategy, a trader must have a Binance account.

The spot trading feature is still new on the world’s largest crypto exchange and is expected to eliminate fear of missing out (FOMO) and make strategic, informed, and rational trading decisions on behalf of the traders.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL21vZ3VsZG9tLmNvbS8zOTI5MTgvc3RvcC1ndWVzc2luZy1ob3ctc21hbGwtcmV0YWlsLWNyeXB0by10cmFkZXJzLWFyZS11c2luZy1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtZ3JpZC1ib3QtdHJhZGluZy1zdHJhdGVnaWVzLXRvLWdhaW4tcHJvZml0cy1hbmQtYW4tZWRnZS_SAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly9tb2d1bGRvbS5jb20vMzkyOTE4L3N0b3AtZ3Vlc3NpbmctaG93LXNtYWxsLXJldGFpbC1jcnlwdG8tdHJhZGVycy1hcmUtdXNpbmctYXV0b21hdGVkLWdyaWQtYm90LXRyYWRpbmctc3RyYXRlZ2llcy10by1nYWluLXByb2ZpdHMtYW5kLWFuLWVkZ2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Bitcoin and Web 3

Trust Machines and Stacks

Bitcoin and Web 3

We hear a lot about two concepts with contradictory outcomes. One being web 3 and the other bitcoin being the “currency of internet”. The latter is a phrase used often by Jack Dorsey. There is a giant chasm between web 3 and bitcoin being the native currency of the internet. What is it? Well, most bitcoin maximalists, and highly respected ones like Adam Back, see web 3 as a venture capital grift. Meaning, to them, bitcoin is incompatible with web 3.

I like decentralized web. unfortunately i think web3 has being abused as a marketing buzzword for alt coins, which makes no sense. they can't scale minified financial data (in part because they did NOT minify it ? but that's because they are incompetent). — Adam Back (@adam3us) December 21, 2021

So will bitcoin be left out of web 3? If Stacks (STX) has any say in the matter, then no. For bitcoin to be native of currency of the internet, an internet transitioning to the nebulous web 3, then bitcoin will need smart contract capability. This is where Stacks comes in. (See here for a detailed explanation of how Stacks is anchored to bitcoin.)

In short, Stacks settles on Bitcoin. The thrust of Stack is bringing smart contracts, and thus, DeFi to bitcoin. This lofty goal is about to be even more accelerated as Stacks announced today they raised $150 million to build ‘Trust Machines‘, a company co-founded by Stacks founder Muneeb Ali with Princeton computer science professor Dr. JP Singh.

2/ Along with JP Singh, a Princeton CS Professor, I’ve started Trust Machines to unlock the next chapter of Bitcoin apps. Building upon the success of Stacks, Trust Machines will build the apps and underlying tech to unleash the true potential of Bitcoin as a settlement layer. — muneeb.btc (@muneeb) February 3, 2022

Trust Machines and Stacks

According to the announcement, the new entity will “unleash the true potential of bitcoin by developing decentralized finance applications, DAOs and NFTs on Stacks.” The $150 million war chest was raised by some of the biggest names in the game, such as Digital Currency Group, Union Square Ventures, and GoldenTree. It is certainly true that with this move, the potential for bitcoin to thrive in Web3 is at stake.

In essence, this should make the Jack Dorsey’s of the world elated, but because Stacks has its own “pre-mined” STX token needed for executing the smart contracts, Stacks is not greeted with glee from most of the cloistered bitcoiners, barring Dan Held and others who are fond of the project.

Pre-mined simply means the coins are distributed before launch (to community incentives, foundations, and the like) rather than mined; simple as. Hardline bitcoiners argue this is an ‘a-priori death knell’ to the legitimacy of a protocol, but they fail to realize bitcoin (for example) was “pre-mined” by…well…the earliest miners. It is a distinction without a difference. Really, the pre-mine narrative is an oblique philosophical tenant with the simple and vain gripe that any non-bitcoin token hurts bitcoin’s price.

? excited to see what Trust Machines can do! — Dan Held (@danheld) February 3, 2022

Jim Breyer, founder, and CEO of Breyer Capital, is one of the major investors in the new project. He was one of the earliest Facebook investors. Speaking on the fundraise, he said: “We believe that bitcoin can be more than a store of value; it can also be the settlement layer and platform for Web 3.” As Muneeb Ali puts it: “Bitcoin as a programmable Layer 1 is so under-appreciated.”

Ali believes that Stacks is now ready to carry the torch to help bitcoin become more than a store of value. Stacks is more entrenched and mature than many realize. As an example of just how much some believe in Stacks, Harvard Management Co., “the firm managing the top university’s $41.9 billion endowment”, bought a $11.5 million in Stacks tokens in 2019.

As Forbes put it: “In many ways, bitcoin smart contracts could be considered the Holy Grail of crypto.” That is a truer statement than most realize.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vc3RhY2tzLXN0eC1yYWlzZXMtMTUwLW1pbGxpb24tdG8tbWFrZS1iaXRjb2luLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtbGF5ZXItb2Ytd2ViLTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

An Ontario-based organization in charge of administering pensions for teachers once again invested during FTX’s latest fundraise, but residents of this Canadian province still can’t use FTX.com.

FTX Trading Ltd., the owner and operator of major crypto exchange FTX, said that they closed a USD 400m Series C fundraise – Increasing the valuation of the company to USD 32bn.

Among the participants is the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, an independent organization responsible for administering defined-benefit pensions for school teachers of the Canadian province of Ontario. The Board claims it had $227.7bn in net assets as of June 30, 2021.

Yet, notably, Ontario is a restricted market for FTX. The exchange states that there “may be partial restrictions” in certain jurisdictions, “potentially including” Canada, while “FTX also does not onboard any users from Ontario.”

And it's not the first time either: the organization announced back in October last year that their Teachers’ Innovation Platform (TIP) had participated in the USD 420m funding round for FTX. ""TIP focuses on growth equity and venture capital investments in companies, such as FTX, that are using technology to shape future markets,"" they said at the time.

Meanwhile, according to FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, they “will look to continue interacting with regulators to facilitate access to digital assets in a safe and compliant manner.”

It’s not just FTX that may land in regulatory trouble should it offer services to Ontario residents. In December 2021, the Ontario Securities Commission warned investors that cryptoasset platform Binance is unregistered in Ontario, therefore not authorized to sell any derivatives or securities in the province.

Meanwhile, other participants in this latest FTX fundraise include Temasek, Paradigm, NEA, IVP, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global, and Insight Partners, among others.

Also, this is the third fundraise within the past six months for FTX.com, bringing the total amount raised to USD 1.8bn, seeing FTX's valuation rise by over 75% in that period.

The announcement further stated that FTX grew “significantly” since the company was valued at USD 25bn in October 2021 – FTX Trading’s user base is up 60% and its average daily trading volume increased 40%, reaching some USD 14bn in daily volume, they said.

According to the company, all “investors involved in the Series C raise simultaneously participated in the previously announced FTX US Series A funding round” which valued FTX US at USD 8bn.

What is CryptoDickbutts NFT?

It’s not everyday you get to write about CryptoDickbutts (CDB), but here we are! Originally created in 2006 by comic book/meme artist K.C Green, “Dick Butts” quickly caught up with the times. Dick Butts eventually turned into the CryptoDickbutts collectors have grown to love in May of 2021.

Originally created much like his memes, as a joke, it quickly became an NFT worth holding; especially among CryptoPunk holders. There is something to be said of the simplicity their images share, so it’s no coincidence they would take a liking to CDB.

CryptoDickButts is actually their third series within the collection. This series was their largest to date with 5,200 within their series 3 collection and a mint price of .052 ETH. 161 were reserved for their OG collectors and another 39 were held for the dev team and giveaways. With no roadmap, no instructions on how to mint, and not much initial direction they quickly sold out because of course they did.

As of press time, CDB holds a floor price of 1.4 ETH. One of the attractive utilities to this project is their DAO and royalties from secondary sales, which will go towards their Community Treasury, “to fund the community…stuff“.

??ALERT?? Henceforth the secondary royalty on all CryptoDickbutt S3 sales will be doubled to 5%!

What is CryptoDickbutts OG?

deleting account at 6969 followers — CryptoDickbutts (@CryptoDickbutts) February 15, 2022

As mentioned above their latest release of CryptoDickbutts is their third release in their series. As stated via their OpenSea page, these “CDB have escaped from Gooch Island and are on the loose“.

Series 1 had only 52 CDB available. With Series 2, they added 104 more CDB to complete their OG Collection. With 161 items in total, their CryptoDickbutts OG collection currently holds a fun/impressive floor of 6.9 ETH. It would seem, as with most projects, OGs will always hold the most value and future utility. With that in mind, it is no surprise to see their OG collection sitting around a $20,000 floor.

The project sticks to its roots and is very meme-centric, which makes it fun for collectors and those within the NFT space. This project truly shows the power of the community, and illustrated the market setting the demand and value for a project.

Where & How To Buy?

With series 1-3 being minted and already sold out, you will have to shop on the secondary market to secure your CDB. Keep in mind there are two collections listed separately on OpenSea. You can find their OG collection on OpenSea here and you can find their Series 3 collection here.

The OG collection holds a much higher floor due to a more limited supply and more anticipated utility. Their series 3 collection saw a nice bump in sales volume on 2/15. Respectivelly, it had over 350 recorded sales and 518 ETH volume for the day.

I would imagine series 4 will be coming in the near future, so keep your eyes on their Twitter and Discord for all the latest news and notes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1jcnlwdG9kaWNrYnV0dHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Though the latest updates from Bitgert have been about the Gate.io listing, the project founder hinted at the Binance listing on the project’s official Telegram page . The news has got a lot of crypto enthusiasts excited as this would have a huge impact on the Bitgert token price. It could be the reason why Bitgert is currently skyrocketing. Below is more about the Bitgert Binance listing and the listing of competing crypto projects:The Bitgert team is currently working on listing the token on tier-1 crypto exchanges. The first exchange has been Gate.io, where $BRISE is going live on 15February. The Bitgert team, through the official Twitter account , has also announced the KuCoin listing. But the most exciting news is about a possible Binance listing that was hinted at by the Bitgert founder This will be one of the biggest milestones for the project and might start the much-awaited bull run. The founder believes that Bitgert has everything to list on Binance. He noted that Bitgert has far better utilities than Shiba Inu, which is already listed on the Binance exchange. Therefore, very soon, the Bitgert team might announce the Binance listing.The Centcex team has not started listing on cryptocurrency exchanges yet. The listing has been put in Q2 2022, immediately after the Centcex team has released several products for the ecosystem. Already, the team has accomplished so much in developing the Centcex exchange, which is the first product in the ecosystem. The Q1 also comprises the staking program and other products. The listing on the tier-2 exchange is in the Q2 of the 2022 Centcex roadmap.The Shiba Inu is one of the meme coins that got listed on Binance and many other crypto exchanges. The coin was doing well at the time of listing and was the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of 2021. With the Shiba increasing by 50,000,000, it was inevitable for any crypto exchange to list even though it had no utility at the time. Though the cryptocurrency has plummeted big time, it is still one of the best performing cryptocurrencies. The recent bull run proved that Shiba Inu is still one of the cryptocurrencies to watch.When it comes to cryptocurrencies listing, there is no crypto exchange that has not listed Bitcoin. There are hundreds of exchanges in the crypto market, and all of them have bitcoin forming parts of the major trading pairs. Therefore, you can rest assured that you are going to find BTC in any exchange that you are trading on. In addition to that, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming popular in the market and is gaining some stability. Therefore, Bitcoin will be one of the cryptocurrencies to watch.There are many reasons Ethereum is still one of the best performing cryptocurrencies and also still the second largest cryptocurrencies by market value. One of them is the powerful Ethereum smart contact that enables developers to build decentralized apps. Though the Ethereum network’s cost and speed have been an issue, there are many Ethereum based projects in the market today. The ongoing upgrade of the Ethereum protocol is expected to make it the best network in the market.The other coin that has been enjoying massive crypto exchange listing is Dogecoin. As one of the largest and oldest digital coins in the market, Dogecoin has been one of the vast listed crypto coins by all exchanges. At the time of this writing, Dogecoin was ranking #11 in the list of the largest cryptocurrencies in the crypto market. This might explain why almost every blockchain coming into the market is listing it. Dogecoin has also been one of the best performers of 2022 so far.The Binance Coin is the 4largest cryptocurrency in the crypto industry today. The coin has been doing very well in the market over the last few years, mainly because of the rapidly growing demand for the Binance Chain. The Binance Smart Chain and the now popular Binance Exchange have been some of the biggest drivers of the Binance coin growth. Their growing demand has been the factor making the BNB coin demand grow and thus the fast-growing coin.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2lmLXNoaWJhLWludS1jYW4tZ2V0LWxpc3RlZC1vbi1iaW5hbmNlLXRoZW4td2h5LW5vdC11cy1zYXlzLWJpdGdlcnQtY29pbi1mb3VuZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

What is My Pet Hooligan NFT?

With a unique collection number of 8,888 and created by AMGI, My Pet Hooligan is one of the hotter NFT buys in early 2022. Publicly minted on 12/14 during the “downtime of NFTs”, these 3D characters are already Meta ready for their PvP & play-to-earn game. The 3D images are sharp, aesthetically pleasing, and have a variety of unique traits.

Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Hooligans are a collection of rebel Bunnies. After being forced to work for $karrots and bound to cages, they rebelled against the CEO of Zuck Corp, Metazuckbot — I wonder who they could be referring to here?

After the rebellion takeover, the bunnies freed themselves and became Hooligans. They split into seven factions with one mission: to disrupt Metazuckbot’s, Zuck Corp.

Not only will your Hooligan be packed with utility, but it will serve as your unique playable character in The Rabbit Hole.

What Is The Rabbit Hole?

My Pet Hooligan is a desktop PvP video game that will incorporate play-to-earn games within their eco-system. The game, which was built with Unreal Engine 5.0 (part of Epic Games), will take place in their Metaverse.

Check out the trailer below to see a sneak peek at in-game play and graphics.

In their play-to-earn game, Hooligans will riot, earn $karrots, and fight against Meta Zuck Bots to end the dreaded centralized Metaverse. The first objective of the game is to build a multiplayer beta game, which will be a giant Hooligan party. From there, they will develop further and lean heavily on community input and suggestions.

$Karrots are their ERC-20 in-game currency used to power The Rabbit Hole game. Final details are in the works on how to reward and incentives, but an update is expected soon.

Where & How To Buy?

Mint was .08 back in December and sold out quickly. The secondary market is where you will have to purchase now. You can find their official OpenSea here.

As of press time, they are holding a current floor price of 1.32 ETH and have 5.2K unique holders. Unique holders are always a strong indicator for any NFT project. Typically, you like to see more unique holders and fewer “whale wallets” holding a bulk of the collection.

2022-02-16,Shiba Inu price prediction - Can SHIB hit a new all-time high in 2022? - Finbold - Finance in Bold,"Cryptocurrency traders will be watching closely to see if Shiba Inu (SHIB), which gained enormous popularity in 2021, can shake off its meme token status and return to all-time highs in 2022.

SHIB has maintained its place in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for some time now, aided by an expanding number of holders as more retail investors enter the market and find the asset as a result of the asset’s enormous community of users.

Furthermore, the token has also benefitted from its accessibility; individuals wanting to buy Shiba Inu Coin will find it available on the top 10 leading cryptocurrency platforms, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken.

CoinGate, Uphold, and VirgoCX, three fast-growing exchanges and crypto trading platforms in the cryptocurrency industry, have also listed the asset.

Besides that, the asset has begun to find real-world applications, whether it is used in stores as a form of payment or through the development of a ‘Shiba Lands‘ in the metaverse, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and burning to reduce the quantity, among many other applications that have increased its viability and increased its utility.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) latest market statistics

Currently, SHIB is ranked 14 by total market cap and is trading at $0.00003085, down 1.55% on the day and 2.11% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap statistics.

SHIB 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap

The token now has a market capitalization of $16.9 billion, but it is still a long way from the $41 billion it hit on October 29, so the question remains whether SHIB will be able to recover to such levels in 2022.

Can SHIB regain $0.00008?

Traders want to see SHIB return to its October high of $0.00008, and with ongoing burn contributions, many anticipate that it will have a big impact on lowering SHIB supply, thus boosting its price.

Notably, the price of Shiba Inu rose by 57% from February 6 and February 8, resulting in a swing high of $0.0000351. Consolidation also started when the four-hour demand zone of $0.0000274 to $0.0000289 was approached, forming lower highs.

In order to determine the direction of SHIB, it is necessary first to identify this barrier. Closing of the four-hour candlestick below $0.0000274 will invalidate the bottom by causing a lower low to be established. In order for a 15% correction to the $0.0000235 support level, this development must first take place.

SHIB support barrier. Source: TradingView

The Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) model developed by IntoTheBlock lends support to this short-term bearish notion for the meme tokens price.

This on-chain indicator indicates that the next stable support level is between $0.0000150 and $0.0000220, with a range of $0.0000150 to $0.0000220. Given that a total of about 134,230 addresses acquired a total of 502.58 trillion SHIB tokens in this transaction.

If the price falls to the previously specified ranges, it is probable that these holders will collect even more tokens, and it is also likely that this is where the SHIB will create a base during a slump.

On the other hand, if this scenario proves the bearish thesis incorrect, it signals that the bulls are in command and are likely to bring Shiba Inu’s price back above $0.00004.

SHIB 2022 price prediction

Finally, crypto trader and host of the podcast The Wolf Of All Streets, Scott Melker, pointed out that holders of SHIB for more than a year have recently been increasing their holdings over the last month in tandem with whale accumulation; he noted that:

“Addresses that have been holding for over one year, have increased their SHIB balance over the past 30 days by roughly 32.48%. And it appears that the institutional or whale appetite has been increasing recently.”

Melker also noted that large transactions worth over $100,000 reveal the level of institutional activity on-chain.

He said:

“The Volume of these transactions increased considerably this week [February 7], recording multi-months high. A total of $389.89m were transacted, but what’s more interesting, is that these transactions account for 81% of the total SHIB on-chain volume.”

SHIB large transactions. Source: IntoTheBlock

In light of the rising use of cryptocurrencies in the market, there is a possibility that SHIB may return to, or perhaps surpass, its all-time highs in 2022.

When speculation became rampant, SHIB witnessed massive gains in 2021, as the market saw a significant amount of speculative activity. Despite this, there is always the possibility of dramatic price corrections, particularly given the large number of SHIB whales accumulating in the market recently.

In spite of this, as the market sentiment slowly shifts back toward the bullish side, with new users expected to enter the crypto space in the coming years, and with leading platforms such as Robinhood who have not listed SHIB yet, the meme coin has every opportunity to return to previous highs this year, but this is still speculative at this point.

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

Cudos and GOATi collaborate on the ultimate alliance for gaming fans globally. The coalition will provide gamers with more games, rewards, experiences than ever before. The alliance is supported by none other than AMD .

The alpha pilot program allows the Cudos monetisation application to synchronise seamlessly with entertainment company GOATi’s gaming ecosystem. This will allow users to earn rewards through the Cudos monetisation application. Rewards will then be redeemable in GOATi’s in-game store in a first of its kind set-up for blockchain gaming.

“We’re excited to work with Cudos and AMD on this fantastic initiative. This partnership represents a sustainable solution to scaling cloud compute power by decentralising the network and rewarding players for making their hardware available when otherwise not in use. This is exactly the type of infrastructure/environmental/reward win-win-win play that suits GOATi’s ‘Greatest Of All Time’ company ethos perfectly,” commented Garth Midgley, Managing Director at GOATi.

All of this couldn't have been achieved without the support of hardware provider AMD, globally renowned for its cutting-edge hardware solutions. Its latest RDNA2 architecture, for example, provides unrivalled compute power, speed and energy efficiency.

Not only does this architecture deliver high-end graphics at lightning-quick frame rates, but when idle, this cutting edge hardware can also be utilised to solve complex mathematical computations. The outputs of these computations will be redeemable to gamers as rewards, thanks to Cudos technology.

Cudos provides a solution to a genuine problem felt by a lot of gamers, and in doing so, takes the gaming experience to a never-before-seen level. Cudos has created a decentralised network for computing hardware, allowing gamers’ machines to be put to better use. By joining their hardware to the cloud, gamers using the Cudos software can redistribute their idle compute power and earn a wealth of rewards.

The Cudos monetisation application will converge with GOATi’s Pavillion Hub to create a goldmine of gaming experiences in the future. The Pavillion Hub seeks to provide users with a new take on gaming today, delivering in-game features such as prized tournaments, sitting at a value of $250,000. Moreover, the Phantasma Chain allows gamers to use or sell their digital and in-game assets freely.

This makes for the optimum alliance. GOATi’s Pavillion Hub provides the next generation of AAA games , complemented by the advanced Cudos monetisation application within the AMD ecosystem.

2022-02-08,You can become an island paradise “crypto citizen” for just $248. But what’s the catch? - CryptoSlate,"As the total crypto market cap creeps back above $2 trillion, for many, thoughts turn once again to quitting the rat race and moving abroad.

Stand-out destinations for the crypto inclined include Puerto Rico, El Salvador, or even Cyprus. But what about Palau?

Through its digital residency program, Palau is opening its door to “crypto citizens” in a bid to attract capital. For just $248, anyone can apply for the Root Name System (RNS) digital residency scheme.

But before you start checking flights, you should know that the RNS program may not be what you had in mind.

Why is Palau turning to crypto?

The Pacific Ocean archipelago of Palau consists of over 500 islands set against delicate sands and unblemished coral reefs.

Having gained independence from the U.S in 1994, Palau now has a “free association” agreement. Meaning the U.S has a 50-year responsibility to defend the sovereign state from the date of independence.

English is one of the three official languages, alongside Palauan and Sonsorolese-Tobian. And with U.S dollars as the national currency, payments are universal, and foreigners visiting there benefit from a substantial degree of purchasing power parity.

Tourism accounted for almost 50% of Palau’s gross domestic product before the health crisis struck. But travel restrictions have decimated this industry, leaving a vast black hole in the country’s coffers.

Scrambling to diversify, through its RNS program, Palau is looking to develop itself into a crypto hub.

For less than $250, you can apply for a “limited edition NFT ID card.” This affords the holder digital residency status, giving benefits such as the use of a Palauan business address and opening banking and brokerage accounts from the region.

These benefits could be useful for crypto investors whose governments oppose digital currency trading.

Digital residency isn’t the same as residency

Sadly, digital residency status does not necessarily mean holders can live in Palau, open a business there, or become a citizen. In other words, the “digital” in digital residency is exactly that.

The RNS website talks about geographic borders hindering life in a “hyper-connected world.” The program seeks to solve this issue by offering the world’s first blockchain digital residency.

“RNS’s mission is to usher in a global and borderless world and support the new generation of global digital existence.“

On the plus side, “RNS partners” have 0% income tax, access to U.S markets, a “stable low-risk environment” (which is debatable considering the country’s worsening debt to GDP ratio), and a physical U.S zip code address.

It remains to be seen how successful RNS will be. But one thing’s for sure, including residency, or perhaps citizenship would make the proposition much more appealing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL3lvdS1jYW4tYmVjb21lLWFuLWlzbGFuZC1wYXJhZGlzZS1jcnlwdG8tY2l0aXplbi1mb3ItanVzdC0yNDgtYnV0LXdoYXRzLXRoZS1jYXRjaC_SAXBodHRwczovL2NyeXB0b3NsYXRlLmNvbS95b3UtY2FuLWJlY29tZS1hbi1pc2xhbmQtcGFyYWRpc2UtY3J5cHRvLWNpdGl6ZW4tZm9yLWp1c3QtMjQ4LWJ1dC13aGF0cy10aGUtY2F0Y2gvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Introduction

Bittrex is a global cryptocurrency exchange offering over 250 cryptocurrencies to buy, sell, and trade. Users can benefit from relatively low fees, multiple order types, and a range of security features to help keep their funds safe.

While Bittrex is fairly user-friendly, beginners may be overwhelmed by its trading platform and the number of assets it supports. Thus, it could be better suited to more experienced crypto traders and investors.

Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed.

Company Overview

Bittrex was founded in 2014 by engineers Bill Shihara, Richie Lai, and Rami Kawach, and is headquartered in Seattle. This exchange initially offered only crypto-to-crypto trading, but it recently introduced fiat-to-crypto trading as well. However, it’s worth noting that its fiat trading program is relatively new, so trading pairs are limited and fiat trading isn’t available everywhere.

Bittrex does offer a great selection of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Not all are available for fiat purchase, but a decent amount of them are offered. This exchange is available in 46 U.S. states, excluding Connecticut, New Jersey, Hawaii, New York, and Vermont.

Cryptocurrencies Available on Bittrex

Bittrex supports over 250 cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. This wide selection makes it an attractive platform for those looking to trade popular coins as well as lesser-known options. Here’s a partial list of assets available on Bittrex.

Bitcoin (BTC)

Ethereum (ETH)

Cardano (ADA)

Chainlink (LINK)

Dogecoin (DOGE)

Polkadot (DOT)

Polygon (MATIC)

Tether (USDT)

Trading Experience

The trading experience on Bittrex is fairly straightforward. Users can log in to their trading dashboard on desktop or through the Bittrex mobile app, available for Android and iOS. The desktop interface offers a simple “Instant Buy/Sell” option where users can quickly make trades or purchase crypto with a debit card, credit card, bank account, or Bittrex account balance.

In addition to a straightforward trading experience, users can also benefit from a real-time view of the markets available on Bittrex. The platform also supports advanced order types, including stop, stop limit, trailing stop, and ladder limit orders. Those interested in staking can earn up to 5.5% in Cardano (ADA) rewards by staking ADA on Bittrex.

Fees

Bittrex offers a simple maker/taker fee structure, which is useful for those interested in cost transparency. As with many other crypto exchanges, fee discounts are available for higher-volume traders. Overall, Bittrex’s fees are on par with fees of other major exchanges like Kraken, though some exchanges do offer lower fees.



Here’s a look at Bittrex’s fee structure:",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vYml0dHJleC1yZXZpZXctNTIxNjg1MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-01-26,Cryptoverse Laughs Off IMF Bitcoin Threats to El Salvador With ... - Cryptonews,"Cryptoverse Laughs Off IMF Bitcoin Threats to El Salvador With Memes, BTC Rises

Source: Nayib Bukele / Twitter

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has told El Salvador to water down the law enforced last year that made bitcoin (BTC) legal tender – and the country’s President Nayib Bukele has responded with a dismissive Twitter meme using footage from the TV show “The Simpsons.”

Meanwhile, bitcoin is moving up today, despite this latest pressure. At 9:32 UTC, BTC is up 3.7% over the prior 24 hours, trading at USD 37,824. It's down nearly 11% in a week.

In a press release, the IMF noted that its directors had “urged” El Salvador to “narrow the scope of the bitcoin law by removing bitcoin’s legal tender status,” adding that “some directors” had “also expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing bitcoin-backed bonds.”

The latter is a reference to Bukele’s grand plans to create a tax-free haven for international BTC advocates named Bitcoin City – and fund it using BTC-backed bonds.

The IMF also noted that there was a “need for strict regulation and oversight of the new ecosystem of the [state-run Chivo BTC wallet] and bitcoin.”

El Salvador has been largely dependent on IMF financial support in recent decades – and the body could well follow up by threatening to cut off or suspend its aid to the Central American nation.

But Bukele appears to believe that his newfound BTC community allies will help him attain what many believe is his ultimate goal – decoupling from the USD and Washington’s sphere of influence.

Samson Mow, the Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer and a key ally in Bukele’s adoption drive, wrote off the IMF’s statement as “irrelevant.”

He shared an excerpt of a video interview where he explained:

“I don’t think these organizations like the IMF and the World Bank are really relevant in a world based on bitcoin. […] They can make money out of thin air. You can’t do that on a bitcoin standard.”

The Twitter account operated by Bitcoin Beach – a resort that has been operating a bitcoin-based economy for several years, and may have inspired Bukele to adopt a nationwide BTC economy – also feted the “bullish” quantity of memes circulating in support of El Salvador.

The account operator shared a meme showing an out-of-control horse flattening a woman who tried in vain to stop its charge – equating the horse with El Salvador and the woman with the IMF.

It also sent a (meme-powered) message of defiance.

The Castle Ventures partner Nic Carter predicted:

“Bitcoin will outlive the IMF.”

Others, meanwhile, suggested that the IMF was trying to close the stable door after the horse had already bolted.

Some suggested that Bukele was becoming a bête noire for the IMF, with one Twitter poster using a famous scene from the movie “The Shining” to illustrate their point.

Source: MyLegacyKit / Twitter

Furthermore, people argued that this IMF's move shows exactly why Bitcoin is needed. Dennis Porter, the host of the Smart People Shit podcast, argued that ""the IMF having to ask El Salvador to stop using Bitcoin is exactly why this technology is so powerful."" If the country doesn't comply, the citizens ""can still have access to a global financial rail,"" he wrote.

But not everyone seemed to think that Bukele’s brash defiance of the IMF and Washington was a wise move.

The bitcoin podcaster and author Anita Posch wrote that the “keys to the some BTC 1,300 held by El Salvador are with the United States company BitGo.”

Posch continued:

“International organizations and the United States government could force BitGo to cut off El Salvador’s access to its custodial cold storage. Who has the keys to the funds of Salvadorans using the Chivo wallet?”

Leo Wandersleb, the Founder of WalletScrutiny, concurred, writing:

“[Bukele is] poking the bear, but as far as I can see, he’s sleeping in the bear’s cave. I would have nightmares non-stop being this kind of vulnerable to a hostile nation.”

Some have suggested that this year will see other nations join El Salvador in its adoption drive. In its outlook report for the year, CoinShares stated that other ""comparably situated sovereigns"" are probably carefully watching to see what economic benefits may result from El Salvador's BTC adoption.

Indeed, the firm noted, the nation now appears to be playing the role of the canary in the coal mine for other nations, who are keenly following its progress from the sidelines.

The report’s authors wrote:

“If the data coming out of El Salvador later this year show significant benefits from including bitcoin in the national currency selection, other countries will soon follow suit.”

2022-02-25,Hathor (HTR) coin price prediction: can low fees raise prices? - Capital.com,"Hathor (HTR) coin price prediction: can low fees raise prices? – Photo: Shutterstock

Alternative network for scalable and decentralised transactions Hathor’s (HTR) utility coin prices fell over the past two months after its listing on cryptocurrency trading platform Gate.io.

HTR listed on Gate.io on 22 December 2021 after receiving over 20 million votes from the project’s community members. The cryptocurrency aims to be an easy-to-use and cheap blockchain network, where users do not need technical knowledge to issue tokens and carry out transactions on the network.

The Hathor Network coin price fell to $0.5335 on 23 February 2022, down 22% from $0.6823 on 1 February. The Hathor token price is also down 36% compared to a year ago.

HTR coin price hit an all-time high at $2.3185 on 20 November 2021, but dropped the month after. Although prices climbed briefly above $2 in early January, the uptrend was halted and the HTR coin value tumbled the following month.

What is Hathor (HTR) coin?

The Hathor Network is an alternative to the Bitcoin blockchain. The network’s novel architecture is based on the PhD thesis of its founder and CEO Marcelo Brogliato. The Hathor Network is a hybrid of directed acyclic graph (DAG) and blockchain technology. Unlike blockchain, Brogliato claims this hybrid approach will enable the network to scale and process transactions quickly and cheaply.

“We solve a significant challenge in cryptocurrencies, the problems of scalability and decentralisation maintenance among distributed ledger networks, by including a chain of mined blocks inside a DAG of transactions,” said Hathor.

According to Hathor’s executive summary, the network “is the direct result of over seven years of academic research from its founding members throughout which they have been stress-testing its assumptions and alpha versions”. The network was launched on testnet in May 2019 and migrated to the mainnet on 3 January 2020.

As a result of the network architecture, transactions on the network are free, which contrasts with the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks, where transactions incur a high ‘gas’ fee.

Hathor coin (HTR) is the native token for the network, and it is used in the following use cases:

Block rewards. Staking rewards. Virtual debit card. WooCommerce. HathorPay. Hathor Swap.

The network is based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol and miners/validators are required to solve the same Bitcoin algorithms using computation power (hash).

HTR token supply and distribution

Hathor has no fixed supply as the cryptocurrency is inflationary based. According to Hathor’s data on 24 February, the total HTR token supply was at 903.1 million with 227 million HTR tokens in circulation. Hathor has said that:

“The growth in circulating supply is subject to ongoing and unlimited mining rewards and its inflation rate.”

According to Hathor, one billion pre-mined tokens were created on 3 January 2020, but “these tokens are subject to the burn, vault, and lock schedule”.

The project was initially funded by a private investment (seed sale) from family and friends, and 5% of the one billion pre-mined tokens were allocated for this group of investors.

The majority of the pre-mined tokens are reserved for the network treasury and ecosystem, this is “to support the development of the Hathor ecosystem, its community and use cases”.

The co-founding team members will receive 10% of the pre-mined tokens or 100 million HTR coins in December 2024, six and a half years after the project started.

Hathor has also allocated 130 million tokens for sale to the public, and 50 million HTR coins were sold to very early investors in the first quarter of 2019. 20 million tokens will remain locked for future sales after January 2023.

To incentivise miners of HTR tokens and keep the network secure, each block gives 64 HTR as a reward. However, the size of the reward will be halved according to the project’s schedule. The reward will continue to halve each year until it reaches 8 HTR per block after January 2023.

In addition to mining, buyers can buy the token on exchanges such as KuCoin, Gate.io, AscendEX (Bitmax), CoinEx and CoinMetro.

Token and project governance

Founder Brogliato believes that the Hathor project’s governance will be more distributed compared to Bitcoin. “In Bitcoin, users have less bargaining power than miners because they do not contribute with work, whereas, in Hathor, both miners and users are working together. So, when it comes to changing the rules, the bargaining power is more distributed than in Bitcoin,” said Hathor in its whitepaper.

Main features of Hathor Network

According to Hathor, users “can create [their] own digital token with customised specifications on Hathor Network with only one click”. These custom tokens “will work independently of the price of 1 HTR and they can serve multiple purposes: financial participation in a company (‘stock’), mileage or loyalty points of a specific store or network, votes, ownership of digital goods such as website domains”.

This feature will enable non-developers to access the network and could encourage more projects to build on Hathor.

Nano contracts are another feature of Hathor network, which is a simplified version of smart contracts.

Project risk profile

According to cryptocurrency research and data site IsThisCoinAScam, the Hathor project has a safety score of 5.01, data on 23 February 2022 shows. According to the site, Hathor scored more than 7/10 on sentiment and community, while its development was awarded 5.4/10. The other metrics (awareness, credibility and volume) were awarded below five. The score is based on the site’s research on social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter.

IsThisCoinAScam states that HTR coin “is suited to an adventurous investment style” as the token was launched in January 2020 and remained in an early stage, hence some of the project targets may not materialise.

Could Hathor become popular?

Despite the risk of early-stage cryptocurrency projects, some believe Hathor’s scalable and easy-to-use blockchain could become popular and potentially be a good investment. In an article on Teckers, Henry Appah wrote:

“This underrated cryptocurrency recently emerged in 2020 and its project is showing bright signs of investment potential. Even if it’s new to the stage, it can compete with older and more popular cryptocurrencies, especially if more people start to use it.”

HTR price forecast

In its Hathor coin price prediction, Tech News Leader expected that the HTR/USD rate could rise in the next few years, reaching new highs by 2026. The data provider expected the token price could climb up to $0.61 in 2022, and the price uptrend could continue, reaching $0.95 in 2023 and $1.43 in 2024. By 2025, HTR coin was expected to exceed $2, reaching $2.06, and continue to rise to $2.85 in 2026, $4.11 in 2027, $5.74 in 2028, $8.50 in 2029 and $12.24 in 2030.

Price Prediction’s HTR price prediction was relatively bullish in the next eight years. The service estimated the token could exceed $2 in its HTR coin price prediction 2025. Its Hathor prediction suggested the average HTR coin price could be $0.60 in 2022, $0.85 in 2023, $1.19 in 2024, $1.65 in 2025, $2.35 in 2026, $3.44 in 2027, $4.86 in 2028, $6.99 in 2029 and $9.58 in 2030.

According to Wallet Investor's HTR prediction, Hathor coin price could rise to $1.38 in the next 12 months, and possibly reach $4.419 in five years’ time.

While making Hathor crypto price predictions investors should remember that the market is volatile. HTR crypto price predictions are based on inferences drawn from the past performance by analysts and may go wrong, due to market gyrations, change in policies and unknown parameters. Investors should also consider the token’s collaborations, partnership deals and fundamentals before relying completely on the predictions.

You should do research and base your decision to buy cryptocurrencies on your tolerance to risk. Investors should gauge how comfortable they are about losing money, as you should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.

2022-01-12,"US Inflation Jumps Most in 40 Years, Bitcoin, Ethereum Gain - Cryptonews","US Inflation Jumps Most in 40 Years, Bitcoin, Ethereum Gain

Source: Adobe/Vera

In December, monthly inflation in the US was a bit higher than expected, reaching 0.5%, while the annual inflation increased to 7% and was the same as expected.

Economists expected that the consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of consumer prices released by the US Labor Department, will show that inflation jumped by 0.4% in December and 7% year-over-year – the highest increase in prices since 1982.

Bitcoin (BTC) moved up after the numbers were released, jumping from USD 43,400 to USD 43,900 in several minutes, and increasing its daily gains to around 5%. Ethereum (ETH) also moved up, surpassing USD 3,375 and increasing daily gains to 8%.

The annual inflation rate in the US:

While economists disagree on when inflation will peak, it’s well past the initial time frame the Federal Reserve (Fed) had expected to see.

“You’ve got the Fed in panic instead of patient mode, so the risk is overshooting... We’re now in a position of the Fed chasing instead of anticipating. It’s worrisome,” Diane Swonk, Chief Economist at Grant Thornton, told CNBC.

According to Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the UKUK-based based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, there may be a selloff in the crypto market if the inflation numbers are larger than expected. This, however, shouldn’t be a long event, “as I suspect the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario due to the persistent selling recently,” he wrote in an emailed note before the CPI numbers were released.

Sotiriou argued that the on-chain data is “generally bullish,” and that it suggests that these prices could be a buying opportunity, adding:

“Bitcoin has entered the buy zone for dormancy flow, which has only flashed 5 times in Bitcoin’s history, which all lead to incredible rallies. This indicator compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the annual value of destruction – in layman’s terms it compares price to spending behavior. As the percentage of people spending their bitcoin is so low. It shows the sentiment of investors, unwilling to sell their bitcoin at this price.”

As reported, yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during his confirmation hearing that ‘we probably remain in an era of very low interest rates.’

Should he be given another term, argues the founder and CEO of Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan, Powell “will retain his position as the key figure at the helm of the great money printer.” Rather than the statements, it is his “boring presence on the stage” and his “familiar monotonous message” of the economy being able to handle the COVID 19’s Omicron variant while gradually reducing quantitative easing and preparing to eventually raise interest rates – that helped alleviate investors’ concerns and put them at ease.

“It's also important to keep in mind that the markets have declined a lot lately, so they are more than due for an upside correction,” Greenspan wrote.

Meanwhile, in China, the inflation came in lower than expected. China's annual inflation rate fell to 1.5% in December 2021 from a 15-month high of 2.3% a month earlier. The latest reading was less than the market consensus of 1.8%, per Trading Economics data. Reuters noted that, in the case of this country, the “slower-than-expected December producer inflation made room for more monetary easing.”

Contrary to smaller Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto miners, Canada-based Hut 8 would not be ""really affected"" by Ethereum (ETH)'s move to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, as the miner is ready ""no matter what,"" Sue Ennis, Vice President (VP) of Corporate Development and Investor Relations off the company, told Cryptonews.com. Also, Hut 8 is ready to go shopping for other mining companies this year.

Ethereum is expected to transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, now also used by BTC, to PoS this year. However, this move was already delayed multiple times. In either case, when/if it happens, this would leave ETH miners with a lot of computational power they could dedicate to another blockchain that is friendly to GPU-powered mining rigs.

Ennis says that Hut 8 has got “the Ferrari of GPUs.” According to the VP, US tech giant NVIDIA didn't even allow the company to disclose what GPU model they received, because only three customers got it globally.

“We can easily pivot, and mine the next most profitable GPU-based network if we wanted to, or get into some of the use cases that we're looking at, like node infrastructure management, perhaps even supporting some of the pools,” she said.

Per the VP, they can ""flip the switch, and within 10 minutes get paid out in whatever coin it is. ""

""[It’s] too early for me to confirm which way we're going to go, but we're definitely looking at it,” she said.

Ennis confirmed that the company has looked into a variety of other chains, naming Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) among others, but nothing has been decided yet – nothing at least that Ennis could share at this time.

In either case, according to her, it’s “the smaller-scale guys” with the more inefficient and/or older equipment who would be “a little more out of luck than we would be” should the switch to PoS happen.

Meanwhile, Hut 8 continues to evaluate the “hodl case” for ETH once every couple of weeks, but for now, says the Corporate Development VP, the team prefers to mine Ethereum and “get paid out in BTC at the pool level.” For now, the company will stick with this strategy in order to hodl more BTC.

Hut 8 results in December 2021:

276 BTC were mined, resulting in an average production rate of 8.9 BTC per day;

100% of the self-mined BTC for December were deposited into custody;

Total BTC balance held in reserve is 5,518 as of December 31, 2021, a 97% increase from the prior year-end;

Installed operating capacity currently sits at 2.0 EH/s, a 125% increase in hashrate from December 31, 2020.

The call for Ethereum to stay on PoW

Meanwhile, as reported, Luxor Technology Corporation recently said that they are working with large institutional miners, such as Hut 8 and Hive Blockchain, as well as a number of retail miners in North America, in their ""quest to provide the industry a US-based Ethereum mining pool.""

Additionally, Luxor started organizing and building an advocacy group for Ethereum to remain on PoW, which they argue “ensures network operations remain decentralized and that the mining process has profound, positive impacts on global energy markets.”

Hut 8 is not a member of this group, and as for whether they would join, Ennis says that they are “tight with Luxor guys” and “not against the idea,” but that they need to learn more about it.

Additionally, the Hut 8 team is “pretty close to the [Ethereum] developer community,” said Ennis, adding:

“And we're hearing on the ground that proof-of-stake is so pretty far off, because it's obviously not a technology issue; it's a governance issue. But, sure, [if] proof-of-state happens tomorrow morning, we can easily pivot.”

'Not stressed' about BTC, mulls M&A

As for the recent bitcoin price crash (almost 50% from its all-time high), Ennis said that Hut 8 is “not stressed about this at all” as the company is “incredibly diversified.” They bought data centers and have 400 commercial customers that “are giving us money based on a completely uncorrelated business to digital asset mining, but still in the digital economy space,” she said.

Blockchains and applications are going to need blockchain storage and GPU-based computational storage, so there will likely be “greater upside and growth trajectories in the GPU-based markets.” Furthermore, there is “a ton of potential opportunity with all these budding Web 3 applications” – all of which are going to need storage and will potentially have some node infrastructure management.

“A lot of the equipment that we have is already been fully paid off, fully depreciated – so it's pure profits. A price point that would be of concern for Hut 8 is if BTC went below USD 20,000,” she said.

Today, BTC traded below USD 37,000 and was down around 20% in a month.

As for the hashrate growth, crypto-focused financial services firm BitOoda recently cut their forecast for the year from 334 EH/s to 327 EH/s. Hut 8 too expects it “definitely in the 330 lane,” said Ennis, adding that “a lot of consolidation” is expected as well. Therefore, some of the smaller players with not much hash power and who are still waiting on equipment are probably going to be “kicked off or bought out.”

“We do think it's going to be a really interesting year that's right for M&A. And we did a raise in September of 175 million bucks. […] We're ready to go shopping and be opportunistic, because we think it's going to get pretty hairy for some of the smaller people this coming year,” Ennis told Cryptonews.com

In January, the company acquired the cloud and colocation data center business from TeraGo Inc. The Data Center Business spans from Toronto to Vancouver with over 36,000 sq. ft (3,344 sq. m) of geo-diverse data center space powered by renewable energy sources.

Source: AdobeStock / JorgeEduardo

While bitcoin (BTC) is far from a traditional asset that can be analyzed using conventional frameworks, the blockchain still offers many ways of analyzing the asset, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest said in a newly published whitepaper.

In the paper, titled A Framework to Evaluate Bitcoin, the firm made the case for evaluating the number one cryptocurrency as an investable asset through three layers, with each layer being relevant for a different class of investors:

assessing the health of the Bitcoin Network; assessing buyer and seller behavior; valuing bitcoin.

Source: Ark Invest

Ark Invest’s whitepaper was written by the firm’s in-house analyst Yassine Elmandjra, in collaboration with the bitcoin on-chain researcher David Puell.

Sharing the paper on Twitter, Elmandjra called it “the ultimate manifesto on the power of on-chain data,” and said it represents the culmination of a year’s worth of work on developing a framework for assessing bitcoin fundamentals.

Layer 1: Network health

Starting with the first layer, the paper said this includes assessing things like the network’s security in terms of hash rate, monetary policy, active addresses, and transaction count.

This layer is useful for everyone interested in observing and learning about bitcoin as an investment, the paper argued, saying it could be seen as “a basic fact sheet” about the network.

“Accessed by any blockchain ‘search-engine’, the data in this layer is raw and straight-forward, requiring little to no manipulation,” the paper said.

Further, the report also suggested transaction volume as a good measure of the general health of the network. When divided by the circulating coin supply, the transaction volume offers insight into bitcoin’s annualized velocity, the investment firm wrote.

Source: Ark Invest

Layer 2: Buyer and seller behavior

As the second layer of assessment, Ark Invest suggested that long-term holders and investors in particular may find it useful to look at what wallet addresses are doing, often referred to as “buyer and seller behavior.”

This could include more complex calculations based on on-chain data such as the so-called “HODL Waves” or bitcoin’s realized capitalization, which values bitcoin using the price when each coin last moved on the blockchain, the paper said.

Layer 3: Asset valuation and trading signals

Finally, the last layer in Ark Invest’s framework uses the first two layers to provide relative valuation metrics that are capable of identifying what the paper called “short- to mid-term inefficiencies in bitcoin’s price.”

This layer is especially useful for active investors and traders, according to the report, explaining that it has the potential to generate direct buy and sell signals, similar to how valuation metrics are used in the stock market.

Meanwhile, speaking more broadly on bitcoin as an investable asset compared to other cryptocurrency networks, Ark’s report said that it is important to note that “no other network rivals Bitcoin’s in transparency.”

This makes Bitcoin “the most ‘analyzable’ and fundamentally-sound network” in the crypto space, the report argued.

It added that it sees Bitcoin’s “auditability, openness, and transparency” as stemming from the fact that it has a simple “UTXO-based accounting system,” a verifiable code “that has been scrutinized more than any other open-source software code,” and network nodes that are “much more cost-efficient than alternative cryptocurrency network nodes.”

Led by the well-known technology investor Cathie Wood, Ark Invest is known as one of the most pro-bitcoin major asset managers today. Speaking during a panel discussion hosted by derivatives marketplace Cboe in early 2021, Wood spoke about bitcoin, arguing that “we have just begun. [USD] 1 trillion is nothing compared to where this ultimately will be.”

Crypto.com Resumes Withdrawals After Shutdown From An Assumed Attack

Yesterday, the major centralized exchange and crypto wallet Crypto.com paused withdrawals because of users reporting suspicious activity on their accounts. The exchange reported that it was only “a small number of users” that suffered from the attack, but the number of complaints regarding lost funds rose exponentially since the announcement of the paused withdrawals.

Crypto.com said via a tweet that they were only pausing withdrawals briefly, but that ended up taking about 12 hours.

Update: Withdrawal services have been restored.

All funds are safe. It will take time to clear the backlogs. We appreciate your patience. https://t.co/ZKMfyTMebi — Crypto.com (@cryptocom) January 17, 2022

The shutdown came after multiple users reported that they had lost funds in their accounts. Users reported numerous different assets being stolen, even up to 4.28 ETH and 2 BTC. Furthermore, users that were hacked, including Ben Baller (crypto enthusiast and jeweler), claim to have had two-factor identification enabled.

I messaged yah guys hours ago about my account having 4.28ETH stolen out of nowhere and I’m also wondering how they got passed the 2FA? — BEN BALLER™ (@BENBALLER) January 17, 2022

More shockingly, it appears that it wasn’t even Crypto.com who first reported details that they were getting hacked. The co-founder of Dogecoin, Billy Markus, noticed that there was a suspicious trend in the transactions on Etherscan regarding hot wallets on Crypto.com.

Crypto.com is the first centralized exchange to have fallen victim to an attack in 2022. Multiple centralized exchanges were hacked in 2021 including Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin. However, it appears that Crypto.com was able to return all funds to users. In order to apply caution moving forward, the exchange issued an update that required users to sign in and reset their 2FA information.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vY3J5cHRvLWNvbS1yZXN1bWVzLXdpdGhkcmF3YWxzLWFmdGVyLXNodXRkb3duLXllc3RlcmRheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Binance said Monday it will block the accounts of Russian individuals who have been sanctioned, but will not ""unilaterally"" freeze the accounts of all Russian users. The comments come after Ukraine's vice prime minister called on major cryptocurrency exchange to block all Russian user accounts. ""We are not going to unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users' accounts,"" a spokesperson for Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, told CNBC. ""Crypto is meant to provide greater financial freedom for people across the globe. To unilaterally decide to ban people's access to their crypto would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists.""

On Sunday, Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine, asked major exchanges to block the addresses of Russian users. ""It's crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users,"" Fedorov said in a tweet. Belarus is a Russian ally. Russia continues to attack major cities across Ukraine, but the country's forces are believed to have mostly held off Russian advances. The U.S. and European Union have responded with sanctions targeting Russian banks, sovereign debt, Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle and the leader himself. The Russian ruble has plunged as a result. Binance said it is ""taking the steps necessary to ensure we take action against those that have had sanctions levied against them while minimizing impact to innocent users.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjgvYmluYW5jZS13aWxsLW5vdC1ibG9jay1ydXNzaWFuLWFjY291bnRzLWFmdGVyLXVrcmFpbmUtcmVxdWVzdC5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDIvMjgvYmluYW5jZS13aWxsLW5vdC1ibG9jay1ydXNzaWFuLWFjY291bnRzLWFmdGVyLXVrcmFpbmUtcmVxdWVzdC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-01-05,Ethereum is Halfway Towards its 'Grand Vision' - Vitalik Buterin - Cryptonews,"Ethereum is Halfway Towards its 'Grand Vision' - Vitalik Buterin

Vitalik Buterin. Source: video screenshot, Bankless / YouTube

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has evaluated Ethereum's progress towards its vision to become more scalable and secure while preserving decentralization, asserting that it is some 50% of the way there.

During an episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin detailed that Ethereum's progress would reach 60% after the Merge, when the current Ethereum Mainnet ""merges"" with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system, and would pass 80% once there is a full sharding implementation, which would split the network into multiple portions called 'shards.'

“I would say around 50 [%]. I’d be willing to go past 60 once the merge is fully complete, and I’d be willing to go past 80 once we have a full sharding implementation,” Buterin said when asked to grade the roadmap progress to date - towards what the podcast host David Hoffman described as ""the grand Ethereum vision for what it wants to be.""

In early December, when celebrating the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain's birthday, Buterin released ""an updated roadmap diagram for where Ethereum protocol development is at and what's coming in what order.""

As per the roadmap, the first stage is the Merge, which is projected to happen around May or June 2022 if the code is completed by February. This update will ‘merge’ the Beacon Chain into the mainnet and finalize the transition to PoS.

As previously reported, the Ethereum blockchain's Kintsugi Testnet went live in December, allowing users to test and prototype the Merge. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko called Kintsugi ""a longer-lived public testnet,"" and asked the community to experiment and familiarize themselves with the post-merge environment.

Buterin also revealed that after the Merge there would be a Post-Merge hard-fork, which would enable the withdrawal feature for validators who have locked their ETH so far. He said that the Post-Merge hard-fork could happen around six months after the Merge itself.

The next stage is the Surge, which is all about increasing scalability for roll-ups through sharding. Roll-ups are layer-2 scaling solutions that try to improve the Ethereum network by taking computation and storage off-chain. Sharding, on the other hand, refers to the process of dividing traffic across 64 new chains, thus spreading the network load and increasing speed while lowering costs.

Layer 1 (L1) is the base protocol (the Ethereum blockchain), while Layer 2 (L2) is any protocol built on top of Ethereum.

Buterin noted that with the expansion of the number and the size of shards Layer-1 gas fees might finally come down, but only in the short term. He said that ""realistically in the long term using Layer-1 is just going to keep getting more and more expensive.""

He then concluded that Ethereum users should prepare for the fact that Ethereum is already transitioning away from being a ""Layer-1-centric ecosystem toward being a Layer-2-centric ecosystem."" He added that the gains from switching to Layer-2 will only increase over time, which will eventually push all the activity onto Layer-2.

Meanwhile, Buterin discussed the rise of alternative Layer-1s, or so-called ""Ethereum Killers."" He acknowledged that there has been a lot of demand for scaling and cheap blockchain space over the past year, which explains the meteoric rise of newer blockchains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX).

It is worth noting that a large portion of Layer-1s trade off decentralization for bandwidth and speed. For instance, on BSC, there are 11 validators on the testnest and 21 validators on the mainnet. Meanwhile, Etheruem surpassed 200,000 validators back in July 2021.

However, Buterin argued that people won't care about decentralization if it ""costs USD 8 per transaction."" Back in 2017, Buterin had said that ""the internet of money should not cost 5 cents a transaction.” He reiterated this again too, saying that once sharding comes, transaction fees would be much less than cents 5 again.

2022-01-27,Chrono.Tech Attracts USD 30 Million Investment - Cryptonews,"Chrono.Tech Attracts USD 30 Million Investment

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

Australian asset manager Mark Carnegie and a European Family Office have recently taken stakes in the company, totalling around $30 million, as Chrono’s ecosystem soared in activity and value over the course of 2021.

The growth of the crypto market and blockchain sector has been nothing short of sensational over the course of 2020 and 2021, but Sydney blockchain company Chrono.Tech has enjoyed a particularly impressive run. Chrono’s suite of blockchain-based solutions for the HR and recruitment industry have attracted large numbers of new users as COVID-19 forced a change in working patterns and employment opportunities. Combined with some judicious decisions to build out its offerings and broaden its appeal, Chrono has capitalised on the new normal brought about by life in a pandemic and post-pandemic world, with the result that its ecosystem has exploded in user numbers and value.

With that increase in popularity has come significant external investment in the company from institutional players.

European Family Office

The first investment was made by a European Family Office. Family offices, which manage the assets of wealthy families with a view to growing them and passing them on down the generations, are privately held companies. As such, they have greater flexibility in their investment strategy than institutions such as pension and insurance funds, which manage customers’ funds and are bound by tighter regulation. Family offices typically manage at least $100 million and usually significantly more, and their status has enabled them to be some of the first large investors in cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies.

Mark Carnegie

A household name in Australia, Mark Carnegie is a corporate advisor, entrepreneur and asset manager with three decades of experience. Last year, his fund MH Carnegie & Co announced that it would actively start investing in digital assets , having monitored the space for years. To help in the difficult and specialist business of picking strong candidates from the vast number of cryptos and blockchain firms available, MH Carnegie & Co enlisted Sergei Sergienko, founder of Chrono.Tech and co-founder of Crypto Gaming United (CGU), whose expertise would prove invaluable. In the course of their work together, Mark Carnegie took a personal interest in Chrono.Tech’s network of blockchain products, and ultimately made a substantial investment of his own money in the company.

‘Crypto assets can be highly complex and obscure, and operate on a very different paradigm to the centralised financial sector – not least in terms of secure storage,’ comments Mark. ‘Sergei has a strong network in the crypto community and extensive experience in identifying crypto initiatives that provide an excellent balance of risk and return, making him a natural addition to the team.’

How Chrono.Tech built a thriving blockchain ecosystem

The theme of employment runs through Chrono’s suite of blockchain products and services, with the changing work patterns of the pandemic driving adoption. The first of these products is LaborX , a freelancer platform that allows parties to connect and organise work trustlessly, using smart contract-based agreements that pay out cryptocurrency upon job completion. LaborX is also the means by which users access CGU and the opportunities it brings to maximise their play-to-earn income. The partnership has helped push LaborX’s user base to over 42,000 freelancers, as well as nearly 5,000 customers.

LaborX and CGU users can trade their earnings for other popular currencies on TimeX , Chrono’s crypto exchange and one of the Top 100 trading platforms by volume. It’s also a key trading venue for TIME, which is the native token of the Chrono ecosystem, most notably used as a payment and reward currency for Premium account status on LaborX . In addition to BTC, ETH, and all of the tokens represented within CGU and the wider Chrono universe, TimeX also provides access to AUDT , Chrono’s Australian dollar-backed stablecoin. Like other stablecoins, this is backed 1:1 with fiat funds, but unlike most stablecoins, is regulated – in this instance by AUSTRAC, the Australian financial intelligence agency.

Lastly, the TimeWarp staking programme has proven a strong driver for demand over the course of 2021. TimeWarp enables TIME holders to deposit their tokens to a smart contract and earn a share of revenues from Chrono’s services. Over 50% of all TIME are staked in the TimeWarp contract.

Between the growth of the overall crypto market, the effect of TimeWarp locking token supply off the market, and the demand of revenues being funneled back into the ecosystem, the price of TIME has risen meteorically, repeatedly putting in new all-time highs.

The next phase for Chrono.Tech

The injection of funds for Chrono.Tech comes at a time of unprecedented interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, and enables the company to position for the next wave of adoption.

‘As the world continues to change, Chrono has an opportunity to build the technology that will become the infrastructure for the next generation of web applications,’ says founder Sergei Sergienko. ‘These investments, totalling $30 million, enable us to develop Chrono.Tech’s ecosystem, refining and expanding our products and bringing them to new global audiences. As importantly, they’re a terrific vote of confidence, both in the wider blockchain sector and in our approach to creating Web3 services.’

For LaborX, that will mean launching new features to complement the existing digital contracts, escrow, reputation, and dispute resolution modules. This will help bring the platform into line with the best centralised freelancer portals, while offering greater security, lower fees, and better accessibility for users.

Meanwhile, the team will be adding new coin pairs to TimeX, and building features to cater to the growing community of crypto traders and investors. PaymentX will be integrated with external services, helping to make settling invoices by crypto fast and easy for more people. And, needless to say, all of this will be possible through an expansion of the core team of developers and marketing specialists.

‘We’re still at an early stage in the blockchain revolution,’ continues Sergei, ‘and the long-term impacts on the economy and work patterns of the coronavirus pandemic are only just starting to become clear. We have the opportunity to play a meaningful role in writing the next chapter of history, and a great team to make the vision of permissionless, open, global employment a reality.’",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaHJvbm90ZWNoLWF0dHJhY3RzLXVzZC0zMC1taWxsaW9uLWludmVzdG1lbnQuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

30 ETHDenver hackathon finalists that pitched their ideas to a team of crypto veterans and were competing for up to USD 5,000 in prizes, largely focused on solving common pain points across various segments of the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.

Let’s take a closer look at some of the projects that competed during one of the largest events for the ETH community last week.

In the DeFi category, the four submissions included IdentDeFi, SlowSwap, DustSweeper, and Skew You.

DustSweeper, for example, is working on a solution that allows users to swap small amounts of tokens (”dust”) for ETH without expensive gas transactions, while SlowSwap aims to prevent MEV (miner extractable value)-related issues.

Meanwhile, IdentDeFi aims to create a privacy-preserving know your customer (KYC) architecture by utilizing zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to retain user anonymity.

In the NFTs category, projects like Bunker.finance, an NFT-backed lending protocol that aims to offer instant liquidity via pooling, Mimicry Protocol, which focuses on DeFi derivatives protocol for NFT collections, and Loudverse, a two-sided marketplace for funding hard-to-quantify artworks, made it to the final list.

Going further, Background Network, a decentralized help center, and AcademyONE, an education platform allowing projects to incentivize the creation of high-quality learning materials, were among the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)-focused submissions aiming to use these experimental entities to solve real-world problems.

Also, in the infrastructure and scalability category, projects like Cannon (""a Hardhat plug-in for declaring on-chain dependencies"") and Deus Ex Securitas (which uses machine learning to automatically audit smart contracts) provided their own solutions for infrastructure constraints.

MoonScape, Funbugᵍᵐ, and INDAO were submissions in the gaming and metaverse categories. They offer a number of benefits, including yield opportunities and support for NFTs.

Another interesting submission, in the new frontier category, was ZKmaps, which enables users to prove their location within a bounding area, geofencing, removing the need for disclosing their exact location. Also, among the finalists, was Proof of Meditation which aims to incentivize people to meditate and take more care of their health and emotional wellbeing.

Cannon, Dustsweeper, Proof of Meditation, Deus Ex Securitas, and Loudverse were announced as the winners of the hackathon.

Rap superstar Ye, who changed his legal name from Kanye West last October, is not planning to roll out a non-fungible token (NFT) -- at least not for now. However, he could change his mind later, according to the artist’s recent Instagram post.

“My focus is on building real products in the real world,” the musician wrote on a sheet of paper.

For those who might be wondering what kind of products he had in mind, Ye provided a few examples in his hand-written message to fans: real food, real clothes, real shelter.

“Do not ask me to do a fucking NFT,” the rapper requested from his 10.5m followers on the social media platform.

In the post’s accompanying caption, the Atlanta-born musician denies that his fans will see such a token anytime soon: “STOP ASKING ME TO DO NFT’s I’M NOT FINNA CO-SIGN … FOR NOW I’M NOT ON THAT WAVE I MAKE MUSIC AND PRODUCTS IN THE REAL WORLD.”

At the same time, the letter’s post scriptum leaves some hope for those who would be interested in purchasing a digital asset related to the artist.

“Ask me later,” Ye wrote.

The latest statement comes as the rapper is readying to release his next album, Donda 2, on February 22.

Additionally, it follows the argument West made recently, stating that he should be paid for the photos the paparazzi take of him through the use of NFTs, as it's unfair that he has no rights to the royalties from paparazzi photos.

Meanwhile, Ye’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian is among the celebrities who are being sued by an investor who alleges that they colluded with Ethereum Max (EMAX) co-founders Steve Gentile and Giovanni Perone to pump the price of the token and then dump them, leaving average investors out in the cold.

2022-01-23,When and why did the word ‘altcoin’ lose its relevance? - Cointelegraph,"All cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) were first described as altcoins for a single reason: There was a rise of projects that copied and pasted Bitcoin’s source code. The cryptocurrencies in the early stages weren’t unique enough to have a distinctive term, so “altcoin” (alternative coins) best fit their description. The community, at that point, didn’t put too much thought into other cryptocurrencies due to Bitcoin’s potential advancement — its future price growth, use cases, mainstream adoption, etc. It was the leading head in crypto.

But things changed when people caught onto Ethereum’s smart contract platform, as it can produce “smart contract tokens” — cryptocurrencies with the ability to perform intelligent tasks autonomously.

This led the community to distinguish altcoins from tokens. Altcoins were now coins that had their own blockchain, and tokens were defined as cryptocurrencies created on smart contract platforms. The other factor now at work is that there are many blockchain projects that are scaling rapidly and decreasing Bitcoin’s dominance.

The community started noticing weaknesses in Bitcoin’s correlation to other coins as other interesting new projects popped up, which provoked the crypto world to rethink how it sees cryptocurrencies.

Now, every altcoin distinguishes itself on the market by offering a unique set of features related to things such as transaction management, scripting language, mining mechanisms and consensus algorithms. Although altcoins’ superior features may outperform Bitcoin in one way or another, their value is still completely dependent on Bitcoin’s market capitalization.

Related: Where does the future of DeFi belong: Ethereum or Bitcoin? Experts answer

The community started to envision a world where various cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin, can disrupt the world. Now, with Ether’s (ETH) growing dominance in the market, it’s clear that Ethereum is the leader of crypto innovation. A large percentage of tokens today are Ethereum ERC-20 smart contracts, so the ways token minters classify their projects are easily normalized in the community.

Ethereum’s role in crypto classifications

Ethereum’s ecosystem is responsible for every crypto advancement and for mainstream interest, starting with initial coin offerings (ICOs) — which disrupted the initial public offering model by allowing anyone to buy a project’s coin at launch. The attention from ICOs led to many use cases for ERC-20 tokens, with developers making their next cryptocurrency an Ethereum-based token and crypto users having an incentive to learn more about the tech. With a wide variety of ERC-20 tokens, our human nature must intervene to categorize and associate things.

The term “altcoin” is no longer an acceptable way to define a project, as it’s ambiguous — especially now with decentralized finance (DeFi). People want to know what type of coin it is, whether it be a staking coin, liquidity mining coin, crypto derivative, stablecoin, utility token, etc. They’re aware that cryptocurrencies do much more than send and receive payments.

“Meme tokens” have entered into the crypto vocabulary, too

“Meme token” is a term most crypto users are familiar with due to Elon Musk tweeting to the world about Dogecoin (DOGE). But the crypto community had to make the distinction between tokens and meme tokens, as cryptocurrencies are capable of highly intellectual activity. Tokens based on social media content could potentially affect how the crypto sector is perceived, so a further classification had to be established.

The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) proved that the crypto community is ready to onboard and learn about new definitions. Imagine if NFTs were described as altcoins? By definition, they technically are, but there’s so much that NFTs can do that demonstrates their difference. The community acknowledges that NFTs are ERC-721 tokens and recognizes the capabilities they possess. For starters, they’re structured to make cryptocurrencies unique, with no two tokens sharing the same value.

Related: DeFi and Web 3.0: Unleashing creative juices with decentralized finance

“GameFi” (gaming DeFi) is another term that was added to the crypto dictionary. It deals with merging blockchain technology with NFTs, liquidity mining and other DeFi protocols. The result is games where people can earn real crypto and trade assets. GameFi is still new, so there’s a chance that something trendy will come into existence and result in further classifications within the space.

The crypto community is getting smarter

The crypto community’s collective understanding of the space is improving rapidly. Content creators, influencers and YouTubers are also good at converting complex jargon into easy-to-digest information. The community recognizes that correctly classifying cryptocurrencies increases the chances of finding good new projects early. For example, telling someone that a revolutionary NFT is just an altcoin will influence their first impression and possibly give the NFT less worth.

Classifying cryptocurrencies helps with comparing them. To effectively compare cryptocurrencies, you must know what they are and whether others are doing the same thing. That’s why you can’t compare Dash to something like ADA — one is a payment cryptocurrency, while the other is the utility token of a proof-of-stake smart contract platform.

Another argument for the collapse of the classification of Bitcoin vs. altcoins is the varying correlations between BTC and other coins. While the correlation is high within some pairs, others demonstrate weaker dependence on each other. For instance, ADA and XRP show a lower correlation with other digital assets, not to mention that stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) show negative correlations.

Related: Bull or bear market, creators are diving headfirst into crypto

Classifications also help with diversification. You can have your crypto distributed between several coins, but the phrase “don’t put all your eggs all in one basket” can apply to you if all your coins are under the same classification.

Although a growing number of new crypto concepts are emerging, we can still put them all — DeFi, GameFi, NFTs and meme tokens — under the umbrella of altcoins. From the traders’ perspective, many believe that altcoins will have a larger return in the future, though maybe there is a weaker consensus than there is with Bitcoin, for now.

As a Bitcoin maximalist and the CEO of a crypto exchange, I’m happy to see more classifications arising, as the industry can hardly achieve mass adoption with just Bitcoin.

Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.

Music is a passion for many around the globe. Some find escape in creating wonderful music and some lose themselves in the music produced by other talented artists. Whether you are a creator or a listener, we have all shared a lot of love for music. Amongst many remarkable artists is Eddie Van Halen. Eddie was a musician and songwriter for the American rock band Van Halen.

Eddie co-founded this band with his brother Alex, who was a drummer. The band came to life in 1972 and continued to strengthen their fan base. In October 2020, Eddie Van Halen passed away in California. The legend’s family, friends, and fans have been heartbroken by this incident and are still in the process of recovering from the loss. He earned great respect and fame in the world of rock music.

After his long battle with cancer, Eddie’s soul bid goodbye to the world but his legacy still lives on. The music he had produced is loved and cherished by many. In order to preserve and keep the essence of his passion alive, one of Hollywood’s popular rock and roll underground lounges - the House of Petals will be making its 2022 metaverse debut with Eddie’s NFT Guitar Collection. This collection is more than just a virtual collection since it is backed with genuine custom guitars.

These instruments are priceless and memorable since they are possessions of the great Eddie Van Halen. The NFT’s are not only physical items but also give participants many unbelievable benefits. Special venues, numerous events, greenroom hangouts with many artists, players, influencers and various other perks will be released shortly after the minted release.

The founder of the House of Petals, Joey House, believes in bringing back the culture and soul of music and art of the 90s Hollywood Underground Lounge.

“That’s the core culture and true soul of the project,” says Joey. “I want to bring back some of that feeling of love and collaboration, that raw creative energy that really fuels the art and music world. I want to give that to people in this new incredible way.”

Duquan Brown of Future Media, HOP project lead marketing maven born out of the music industry, is focused on establishing legacy and the art of music in the metaverse in leading this project.

“What we are doing is historic. Now we will be able to share this experience with the WORLD. We want to memorialize the energy of the legendary speakeasy, through the Metaverse, but with a futuristic drip. We will be bold and have off the wall never the same twice experiences each time you enter the House of Petals.”

Many talented personalities are working to make this event a hit. They are ensuring that Eddie’s legacy remains alive. One of these people is Carrie Lyn of Global Management Group, who focuses on bringing long-term value to NFT holders, and ensuring that creators of the metaverse communities make a positive social impact.

“I want to memorialize the history of Rock’N Roll,” Carrie says. “Come to the Metaverse and experience the history of it, versus reading a book or watching a documentary.”

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of these NFT’s will go towards building a community for rock fans. This will be achieved by investing in the House of Petals and making it the home for Rock n Roll. The objective is to ensure that the fans have a place to share their love for good music.

Rock was an integral part of Eddie’s life but he also had a mission for cancer research and treatment. Due to this mission, a portion of his NFT’s will be donated to City of Hope. The rest of the proceeds will be given towards music lessons for underprivileged music students.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctZWRkaWUtdmFuLWhhbGVucy1ndWl0YXJzLWFyZS1lbnRlcmluZy1tZXRhdmVyc2UtdGhyb3VnaC1ob3VzZS1vZi1wZXRhbHMuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

cryptocurrency

market with Bitcoin. The

crypto market

continues to gain traction in various facets of government, business, and personal activities. Since our generation is becoming more technologically driven, individuals wish to realize their financial dreams through the digital medium itself. Financial providers, in particular, are looking for various other methods to create

cryptocurrency

models and ascertain how they can provide financial services in a more non-traditional and transparent manner. There are various sites which are exchanges, trading, or ICO sites that offer various means to generate profits by investing in a cryptocurrency. In this article, we have listed such top sites that are either

cryptocurrency exchanges

or

platforms

and can offer great means of profits.

Coinbase

Coinbase is by far the most popular and one of the best cryptocurrency exchanges that investors can use. They are subjected to purchase more than 30 other coins and tokens, including major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Apart from this, the users can also gain interest in their USDT, and earn token rewards by completing various activities.

Binance

Binance needs to introduction regarding its presence and contribution to the crypto market. This platform is extremely useful for beginners and advanced users.

Kraken

Kraken is another crypto trading platform that possesses a good selection of coins and tokens to trade and invest in. They also allow margin trading and are one of the few platforms that allow investors to trade in Dogecoin and other risky coins.

2022-01-13,Turkey embraces Bitcoin and Tether as the lira keeps spiraling down - CryptoSlate,"The volatility of the Turkish lira is pushing Turks to adopt cryptocurrencies as both a means of payment and a store of value.

The country’s national currency has lost 40% of its value against the dollar since September 2021, leading many to turn to Bitcoin and Tether as alternatives.

Turks ditch the lira, trading gold and dollars for stablecoins

After almost two decades of unbridled growth, Turkey is now suffering from devastating inflation that’s brought its national currency to its knees. Once a sprawling economy, Turkey is now hanging on a thread trying to instill any kind of value into the lira.

However, its citizens are becoming increasingly skeptical of the government’s ability to avoid total currency debasement, and have turned to an even more volatile asset to hedge against potential crisis—cryptocurrencies.

Recent data from blockchain analytics company Chainalysis showed that crypto trading volumes using the lira reached a five-quarter-high in Q4 2021, with an average of $1.8 billion a day traded across Binance, BtcTurk, and LocalBitcoins.

More than half of the trades against the lira in December involved Tether (USDT). The lira became the most traded fiat currency against USDT, outpacing both the U.S. dollar and the euro.

The growing appetite for stablecoins in Turkey stems from the country’s age-old way of weathering economic turmoil—keeping their money in dollars. According to the Wall Street Journal, two-thirds of Turkey’s banking deposits are foreign currencies, with most of them being dollars and euros.

The huge foreign currency deposits don’t go unnoticed by the Turkish central bank, which loans the dollars from private banks to intervene in foreign exchange markets in order to give the lira some footing. However, as most of the central bank’s efforts to prop up its currency were unsuccessful, many Turks have lost the little faith they had in both their government and the country’s banks.

A lot of them believe that a financial crisis is inevitable. If that were to happen, there would be a rush to withdraw dollars—which would have to be taken back from the central bank.

“There is some question whether the government could source the dollars. In a worst-case scenario, some fear the government could force banks to convert dollar deposits into lira,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

To avoid this, tens of thousands of Turks have been exchanging their bank-held dollars for USDT and then using the stablecoin as a gateway to Bitcoin.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL3R1cmtleS1lbWJyYWNlcy1iaXRjb2luLWFuZC10ZXRoZXItYXMtdGhlLWxpcmEta2VlcHMtc3BpcmFsaW5nLWRvd24v0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdG9zbGF0ZS5jb20vdHVya2V5LWVtYnJhY2VzLWJpdGNvaW4tYW5kLXRldGhlci1hcy10aGUtbGlyYS1rZWVwcy1zcGlyYWxpbmctZG93bi8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-02-28,Polkadot's Gavin Wood Under Fire For Ukrainian DOT Donation ... - Cryptonews,"Polkadot’s Gavin Wood Under Fire For Ukrainian DOT Donation Proposal

Gavin Wood. Source: a video screenshot, Polkadot / YouTube

Polkadot (DOT) creator Gavin Wood has found himself under fire from various crypto industry observers after pledging he would donate USD 5m worth of crypto to Ukraine’s fight against Russian military aggression, but only if the country’s government posted an address in the blockchain’s native token DOT.

Wood’s proposal has triggered numerous unfavorable comments, with renowned crypto sector commentator 'grublés' denouncing it as the “lowest rung of shitcoinery.”

“If you, nation literally getting surrounded by aggressors, promote my shitcoin, I'll donate,” the commenter ridiculed Woods’ message in a tweet.

Another Twitter user, Shalom Afraimian, said Poladot’s founder was effectively attempting “to buy an advertisement for [USD 5m]… low.”

Meanwhile, on Reddit, a user who goes by the name of Aldi Westside said they were ashamed to have persons like Gavin Wood in the crypto space.

“If Gavin would really care about helping Ukraine, he could easily swap his DOTs to BTC, $, € or one of the many currencies Ukraine accepts for donations,” Westside said.

This said, some users, such as Sir_Baldington, offered another explanation of Woods’ proposal, arguing that, as Woods lives in Germany, exchanging DOT into bitcoin (BTC) or other crypto would make the donation taxable income, potentially burdening him with major taxes.

“At 5 million [dollars] that would be about 50% in taxes from the gains he made,” according to the user.

This explanation was undermined by another user, RayTrader03, who noted that, if Woods has held the crypto for more than a year, it could be assumed it would not be subject to a tax on capital gains in Germany, as it could be considered long-term crypto benefits.

As of 12:26 UTC, DOT’s price stood at USD 17, down 7% in a day and up nearly 1% in a week.

2022-01-14,"Tesla Accepts Dogecoin Payments for its Merch, DOGE Rallies - Cryptonews","Tesla Accepts Dogecoin Payments for its Merch, DOGE Rallies

Source: Twitter, @haydentiff

Electric vehicle maker Tesla is experimenting with dogecoin (DOGE) payments, opening up a range of products to the cryptocurrency’s users.

The market’s reaction to Tesla’s venture into DOGE has been positive. DOGE rallied 12% in a day and is the second-best performer among the top 100 cryptoassets by market capitalization. Ranked 11th by this measure, at 08:35 UTC, the token trades at USD 0.19 and is also up 20% in a week. Trading volume increased fourfold, surpassing USD 4bn in the past 24 hours, per Coingecko data.

“Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin,” Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, tweeted today.

A new section on the auto company’s website states that dogecoin can be used to purchase merchandise from the Tesla Shop, making it the only cryptocurrency Tesla’s customers are enabled to use to place an order with the vehicle producer.

“Tesla only accepts Dogecoin. Tesla cannot receive or detect any other digital assets. Ensure you are making your purchase with Dogecoin. Sending any other digital assets may result in the assets being lost or destroyed. Non-Dogecoin digital assets sent to Tesla will not be returned to the purchaser,” the company said.

Also, under Tesla’s policy, all dogecoin purchases are final.

“Items purchased with Dogecoin cannot be returned, exchanged or canceled. Items purchased with Dogecoin cannot be returned or exchanged for cash,” they said. However, if “the incorrect amount of Dogecoin is transferred, your order may be subject to cancellation.”

Bitcoin (BTC) users may recall Tesla’s short-lived adventure with accepting payments in the top cryptocurrency. The initial move triggered a surge in bitcoin’s price, however, when Tesla decided last May to suspend vehicle purchases using BTC and announced it was looking at other cryptoassets, the manufacturer moved the whole crypto market and caused a sharp selloff and massive liquidations across the cryptosphere.

This said, Musk has also hinted that the BTC payments functionality could be relaunched if the crypto’s mining process becomes more environmentally friendly in the future.

2021-12-31,Binance vs KuCoin: the Differences Compared in 2023 - EarthWeb,"Binance vs KuCoin is the latest debate for crypto investors.

Both of them are popular crypto exchanges that allow you to buy and invest in many cryptocurrencies. In this article, you will get to know which exchange is ideal for you.

The two most popular Asian cryptocurrency exchanges are KuCoin and Binance.

The government in China banned digital currency exchanges, so both of these major platforms moved to Hong Kong. KuCoin later moved to the Seychelles, and Binance later moved to Malta.

In this article, we’re going to talk about both cryptocurrency exchanges, and cover their benefits and disadvantages, so that you can get a really good idea of which one is going to be more suitable.

We are also going to discuss a few more cryptocurrency exchanges that we think are good options as well, if you would like to expand your repertoire.

Binance

Binance is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange. In fact, it used to be the place to exchange only cryptocurrency back in the day, but these days, you can trade a lot of other things like Fiat currency.

You can also deposit your Fiat currency through dozens of payment methods, and exchange more than 500 listed cryptocurrency coins and cryptocurrency through their staking and saving system, purchase and sale through their marketplace, and even create and trade NFTS on their NFT marketplace.

They even have their own Binance trading bots. They come with a crypto credit card, and while it is still unavailable in large parts of the world, it is definitely one of the best crypto credit cards out there.

It is estimated that there are more than 30 million people using this popular cryptocurrency exchange.

Binance Interface

There are two different types of interfaces on Binance, the advanced, and the basic interface. With their basic version, you’ll be able to see graphs and charts, currency pairs trading, trade history, and your order book.

With their advanced option, you’ll be able to see open orders, currency peers, trade history, as well as a more in-depth analysis of cryptocurrency assets value, so that you can make better trades.

Binance Fee Structure

Binance has divided their fee structure into three different categories. The first is fee for trading, which is at 0.1%.

The second is their fee for deposit, which is 0, and then when it comes to their fee for withdrawal, there is a minimum amount required for withdrawal, but this varies depending on the cryptocurrency coin that you’re wanting to take out.

As an example, if you want to withdraw Bitcoin, the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.002, and the transaction fee is 0.001 Bitcoin.

They adjust their fees according to current blockchain conditions. It is also worth noting that if you use Binance’s native token, you will receive a 25% discount on your fees.

Trading Volume of Binance

Binance is considered number one when it comes to both kinds of exchanges, with a daily trading volume of more than $28 billion, with spot, and $72 billion with derivatives.

Binance Coin

Binance Coin, BNB, is Binance’s native coin, and it is based on Ethereum’s blockchain. You can use the native token to pay for any fees on the Binance platform.

KuCoin

KuCoin was founded by a group of people who were enthusiastic and passionate about blockchain and had already proven themselves with industry giants like GF securities.

Their goal was to provide their clients with a digital asset transaction service that was safe and convenient, and integrated premium assets around the world.

They also wanted to develop a state-of-the-art transaction platform. In layman’s terms, KuCoin is the poorman’s version of Binance.

They have very similar features, including staking, lending, a cryptocurrency card, a marketplace, trading bots, and margin in futures trading.

Interface of KuCoin

Once you have chosen the cryptocurrency pair that you want to trade, the trading screen is going to open up.

You will be able to see your order book, your trade history, and then you will be able to purchase or sell your selected cryptocurrencies.

When you first access the screen, you will be asked for your Google Authenticator code and while this is a little bit annoying, it does add a layer of security to the website that we believe is necessary.

Fee Structure of KuCoin

KuCoin’s fee structure has been separated into three categories. Their trading fee is 0.1%, and the deposit fee is zero. With withdrawal fees, they are similar to Binance; it’s going to depend on which cryptocurrency you are trading.

Trading Volume of KuCoin

KuCoin is number six on the list daily trading, getting means that they trade $1.5 billion a day. Currently, they have 700 cryptocurrency coins that you can trade on their platform.

Which is Safer?

This is a pretty close battle between Binance and KuCoin, because both are seen as super secure as each of them has experienced only one huge hack.

As we mentioned previously, both cryptocurrency exchanges started in China, and soon left due to stringent regulations.

It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where each is headquartered now, but both exchanges aren’t regulated, which means that they are operating in grey areas of regulation, so that they can avoid strict terms and conditions.

You can see this as both a good and a bad thing.

Of course, it is bad because a lack of regulation means a lack of compliance, which means that they have fewer safety measures to keep your assets safe, but it is good because when a platform has to invest less in regulation and compliance officers, this means more profit for everybody.

It also reduces the chances of them going bankrupt.

However, it is difficult for us to see either of them doing anything but growing and becoming really successful in a relatively young industry.

The bottom line when it comes to this question is that they are both safe.

Customer Support

KuCoin has pretty impressive customer support. They have a Telegram support chat that is available 24 hours, and according to existing clients, it has a really quick response rate.

Binance also offers its clients a number of different ways to get in touch with the primary way being through a ticket.

People have said that this can take up to a few days, but aside from that, their customer support is average when compared to other exchanges out there.

Binance vs KuCoin?

So, as you have seen from what we have shared above, there are advantages and disadvantages to both popular exchanges.

Binance has more liquidity than any other platform in the world, as well as low trading fees, and more than 1000 trading pairs available.

Their user verification process is also really simple. However, they aren’t regulated, and sometimes based on regulatory pressure they get rid of some of their popular features.

The other thing to think about is that Binance isn’t actually available in America, and while they do have an American version, it is severely lacking when it comes to features, when you compare it to the main exchange.

KuCoin is smaller, but it is still worth your time. It has a huge selection of trading pairs, as well as integration with protocol which means that it has a high degree of security for you.

It also offers low fees for withdrawals and trading, and it is available in America. The disadvantage to this popular cryptocurrency platform is that it has relatively low liquidity.

Binance has two different versions of its user interface, and both are great looking, offering a few different features based on the fact that one is basic, and one is advanced.

KuCoin offers an interface that is also excellent. They updated it at the end of 2017, and for what you’re paying for their platform, we think it is worth your time.

When it comes to fee structure, both exchanges are pretty similar, with the biggest difference being the fact that Binance needs a certain minimum amount for you to withdraw your assets, while KuCoin doesn’t.

Binance also offers its clients a generous discount if you use their native token.

As far as daily trading volume Binance is the obvious winner. It also supports more digital coins, but KuCoin is quick to pick up on new coins to add to this space.

Both exchanges are worthwhile, as both are very popular and fast growing. Both support a huge amount of cryptocurrency assets and are great for daily trading.

If you’re looking for a bigger liquidity pool, then you should go with Binance, but if you’re looking to be able to invest in new and relatively obscure cryptocurrency tokens, then go for KuCoin.

Other Great Options

Now that we have discussed the ins and outs of Binance and KuCoin, let’s take a look at some other popular cryptocurrency exchanges that we definitely also recommend.

eToro has a way of helping its clients trade with confidence when it comes to their cryptocurrency exchange, and we love that they say that they are not only one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency trading platforms, but they’re one of the world’s biggest social trading platforms.

👉 Get Started with eToro

This means that you can connect with like-minded traders, and learn off their existing strategies, which is going to be helpful if you are just starting out. They also don’t charge their clients a commission on their investments.

Pionex is definitely one of our favorites when it comes to being a cryptocurrency exchange, because they are free for you to make the most of.

This means that you won’t have to pay to sign up for them, and you also won’t have to give up any personal information that you don’t feel comfortable sharing.

They are literally just asking for your email address; you’ll be able to access their features.

Another thing that we really appreciate about this cryptocurrency exchange is that they don’t have a minimum deposit, so you don’t have to have a huge number of cryptocurrency tokens and assets in order to use them.

Uphold is another super popular cryptocurrency exchange that can help you trade easily between your favorite crypto currencies, but they have also expanded their feature list recently to include American stocks, and precious metals, so you can keep all of your assets in one place.

We like that they also help their clients with automatic trading, which means that you can trade on the go and set up recurring trading strategies without having to switch things out constantly.

At the end of the day, this cryptocurrency exchange says that they offer their clients a more versatile home for their financial lives.

Final Thoughts

Ultimately, if you are planning on being successful in the cryptocurrency investment industry for a long time, you will want to pick the best cryptocurrency exchange is going to think about your needs on a long-term basis.

Obviously, there are plenty out there for you to choose from, so you’ve got to be discerning, and do a little bit of research beforehand so you can feel confident that the one you’re going for is going to suit your needs at best.

As you can see, we’ve got a few options above. In the battle of Kucoin vs Binance, we have come to the conclusion that you can use either one of them; it all comes down to what you’re hoping to get out of a cryptocurrency exchange.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vZWFydGh3ZWIuY29tL2JpbmFuY2UtdnMta3Vjb2luL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-02-08,Autobet Lottery Ecosystem Looks To Offer A Wide Array Of Services ... - Cryptonews,"Autobet Lottery Ecosystem Looks To Offer A Wide Array Of Services And Features

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

Even before the emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, people from all over the world had been regularly participating in lottery-based endeavours. There is hence no reason as to why this wouldn’t continue with the usage of crypto and blockchain-based technologies, and that is precisely where a platform such as Autobet comes into play.

If crypto-oriented lotteries are the main topic of interest, then Autobet should definitely be looked at. This platform allows crypto lottery creators or bookies to not only use the lottery provided by Autobet to draft a contract to run the lottery, but also utilize the airdrop program to attract the players in exchange for exciting benefits.

Why Autobet?

One of the most common issues related to lottery-related activities is a lack of fairness, security and transparency. This would not be a problem anymore though thanks to platforms like Autobet which also have a strong sense of community and reward-based incentives and lotteries . As such, any interested party can do a one-off registration which will allow them to be crypto lottery creators. After the contract has been deployed, these creators can then market the platform to their respective networks in order to promote the platform for various other players to enjoy. Once a winner is declared, the prize is automatically paid to the winner while the lottery creator takes all revenue that is generated from the game which he conducts.

Furthermore, in an effort to attract additional players, Autobet has introduced BET token airdrops. According to the team, BET is the platform’s utility token that is poised to become a real gem in the crypto market after the platform fully delivers its products as per the roadmap . Players can hence earn BET tokens via airdrops for early participation as well as contribution to the platform.

Lastly, Polygon network has been selected for deployment purposes and all users are therefore required to connect via this network which has the distinct advantage of having low gas fees and transaction costs. More information and instructions on how to use the platform can be found on the website’s ‘Help’ tab.

Accomplishments, goals and overall vision

Autobet is currently fully functional with smart contract and auto-payout capabilities for both winners and lottery creators. BET shall be used as the official internal currency for the platform and can also be utilized for ‘Fractionalized NFTs’ systems regarding owning pieces of different lottery or gaming based products which Autobet might have. Moreover, the platform has partnered up with India’s Sparkplus Technologies and its strong team that helped Autobet’s accomplishments to take place within a single calendar year.

In terms of future aspirations, Autobet plans to initiate an IDO with 30% of the token supply and to also list BET on various exchanges for trading purposes, with a potential listing on a DEX taking precedence. The lottery module shall also be launched on the mainnet with completely operational core lottery features. Finally, the platform will be rolling out its other lottery products and brands, with the BET token once again serving as the official medium of exchange.

About Autobet

Autobet is the world’s inaugural decentralized and fully automated lottery ecosystem which utilizes blockchain technology. It possesses the power of decentralization which makes it possible to withdraw the lone authority aspect, thereby making it a fully trustless system for all parties involved. Additionally, the platform includes automation to reduce human involvement. This not only makes the system more fair and safe, but also transparent as everything is recorded on the blockchain.

It is important to note that an Ethereum (ETH)-compatible browser or extension such as MetaMask must be used in order to gain full access to Autobet’s various features, products and services.

2022-02-12,Why Singapore is one of the most crypto-friendly countries - Cointelegraph,"In her monthly Expert Take column, Selva Ozelli, an international tax attorney and CPA, covers the intersection between emerging technologies and sustainability, and provides the latest developments around taxes, AML/CFT regulations and legal issues affecting crypto and blockchain.

At the end of 2021 — a year in which Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) rose 100% and 300%, respectively — global crypto rating company Coincub ranked Singapore as the most crypto-friendly country in the world due to its “robust economy, positive legislative environment, and high rate of cryptocurrency adoption.”

Cryptocurrency consumer protection law

Singapore’s regulators have done a great deal to nurture the blockchain industry. Its No. 1 ranking by Coincub was proven right by the prompt regulatory measures implemented by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s main financial regulatory body, when the cryptocurrency market began crashing during January 2022 and entered bear market territory.

During mid-January, Singapore’s MAS enacted consumer protection laws for investors exposed to constant reminders of digital assets via billboard ads or crypto ATMs, banning all cryptocurrency-related advertisements and ATMs in public spaces.

Related: Clampdown on crypto ads: A one-off or a new phase of global regulation?

In a statement, MAS said that while it “strongly encourages” blockchain technology development and innovative crypto use cases, cryptocurrency trading is “highly risky and not suitable for the general public.” As such, cryptocurrencies should not be portrayed “in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading” them.

Payment Services Act, January 2020

In January 2020, Singapore’s Payment Services Act came into effect as a response to the Financial Action Task Force’s 2018 update to its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) cross-border risk guidelines for cryptocurrencies. The Payment Services Act is a flexible framework for the regulation of payment systems and payment service providers in Singapore that establishes registration requirements along with AML and CFT guidelines for cryptocurrency businesses.

MAS has been selective in issuing licenses to cryptocurrency businesses, with a large number of applicants failing to receive licenses to operate in the country. DBS Bank — Singapore’s largest bank — as well as OCBC Bank, IBM and two institutional-grade Bitcoin funds launched by Singapore-based fund manager Fintonia Group are among those that received licenses to operate.

Initial coin offerings

In response to a wave of initial coin offering launches, MAS first published guidelines in August 2017 indicating that if an ICO was deemed to be issuing a security, it would be subject to regulation. This was followed by MAS issuing “A Guide to Digital Token Offerings,” which provides further explanation and direction on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Singapore.

Taxation of cryptocurrencies

Singapore is a low-tax jurisdiction. According to Desmon Teo and Lee Vin Wee of Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore exempted digital payment tokens from goods and services tax effective Jan. 1, 2020. Since there are no capital gains taxes in Singapore, capital gains derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies are not taxable either.

Blockchain adoption

Singapore, which is a major financial center and shipping hub and has the tenth-highest GDP per capita, has emerged in a short period as a global cryptocurrency hub amid its favorable regulatory and tax infrastructure and by utilizing blockchain technology in many areas of its economy. MAS is bullish on the potential of crypto and blockchain, particularly in expediting cross-border payments and trade finance, but frowns on cryptocurrencies as investment assets for retail investors.

Cryptocurrency exchanges

According to one survey, 43% of Singaporeans own cryptocurrency. In comparison, the overall crypto ownership rate is 11.3% in South Africa, 10.5% in the United States and 9.8% in Sweden.

Retail investors can trade cryptocurrencies on a multitude of crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, FTX, Bybit, KuCoin, Vauld, Independent Reserve, Gemini, Coinhako, Tiger Brokers, Futu’s Moomoo and Syfe. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, acquired an 18% stake in the Singapore-regulated private securities exchange Hg Exchange before announcing it would discontinue its operations at Binance Singapore by mid-February 2022. This announcement was followed by a special report by Reuters detailing Binance’s opaque corporate structure coupled with weak global AML and CFT compliance.

Huobi, the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange, also announced it would be shutting accounts in Singapore by the end of March 2022. SIX Digital Exchange — a sister company of SIX Swiss Exchange, which operates Switzerland’s national stock exchange — announced a partnership with SBI Digital Asset Holdings, a division of Japanese banking and financial services giant SBI Group, to establish a crypto exchange and central securities depository in Singapore. The joint venture, called Asia Digital Exchange, is designed to create a regulated, global liquidity pool for digital assets between Asia and Europe.

Banking

A multitude of big banks — including Barclays, BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Orient Securities, Standard Chartered, Societe Generale and United Overseas Bank — have joined Marketnode, a digital asset joint venture of major investment holding company Singapore Exchange (SGX) and government-backed investment firm Temasek. The goal is to explore the use of blockchain technology focused on capital markets workflows through smart contracts, ledger and tokenization technologies. Marketnode also partnered with Singapore-based fintech firm RootAnt Global and United Kingdom-based blockchain platform SETL to focus on fixed income and multi-asset end-to-end infrastructure development.

Grab — a Singapore- and Indonesia-headquartered company focused on mobile applications for transportation, food delivery and cryptocurrency payments — and Singapore Telecommunications have each acquired a 16.3% stake in PT Bank Fama International in order to pursue digital banking opportunities in Indonesia. The two collectively secured a digital banking license in Singapore.

Cap and trade and renewable energy trading exchanges

Efforts for a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic have been gathering speed around the world, particularly following the COP26 conference in November 2021. Singapore is vulnerable to rising ocean levels as a result of global warming, with 30% of the landmass less than five meters (16 feet) above sea level.

Singapore uses natural gas to generate power, and the nation’s Sunseap Group, a solar energy system developer, plans to spend $2 billion to build the world’s largest floating solar farm in the Indonesian city of Batam, doubling its renewable energy capacity. Temasek is collaborating with DBS Bank, SGX and Standard Chartered to create a blockchain-based exchange, Climate Impact X, to trade carbon credits. The country already hosts a blockchain-powered exchange for renewable energy trading from utilities provider SP Group.

Green cryptocurrency mining companies

Cryptocurrency mining is the process of obtaining new tokens by solving complex calculations performed by powerful computers, which demand a large amount of electricity to function. China, once the world’s largest crypto miner, cited the instability of cryptocurrency values when it shut down crypto miners in May 2021, as the profitability of mining companies is tied to the price of cryptocurrencies.

Bitdeer, Saitech, Sharemine AI and BitFuFu are all Singapore-based cryptocurrency mining companies with mining operations outside the country. Bitdeer and Saitech are seeking to be publically listed on Nasdaq. Saitech recycles the waste energy from mining for use in residential, agricultural and industrial applications. Bitdeer and Sharemine AI mine with clean energy generated from hydroelectric and solar power.

Shipping

A recent study carried out by Nanyang Technological University in Singapore examined Singapore’s and China’s shipping industries to show that digitizing shipping documents could reduce more than 99% of the carbon emissions that result from the use of paper documents.

PSA International, the world’s largest container port operator — with flagship operations in Singapore and Antwerp and locations in 26 countries — is exploring using blockchain and digital assets for decarbonization goals. The company is a participant in supply chain blockchain platforms TradeLens and GSBN and an indirect minority shareholder in Global eTrade Services, which offers its Open Trade Blockchain for documents. PSA signed a deal with Singapore consulting firm RHT Group of Companies for an environmental, social and governance project.

Startups

Tribe Accelerator is a blockchain accelerator launched by Trive Ventures, a Singaporean venture capital firm, with the core goal of increasing and streamlining blockchain adoption in Asia, beyond financial services applications. It is the first blockchain accelerator supported by the Singaporean government (it is backed by Enterprise Singapore). It is also supported by ecosystem partners including Temasek, MAS, Citibank, IBM, Intel and BMW.

Tribe has accelerated more than 50 startups with a combined value of more than $1 billion. In November 2021, Microsoft launched its Singapore GreenTech Challenge to accelerate progress in startups in an effort to implement Singapore’s Green Plan.

Central bank digital currency

Singapore, through its Project Ubin, is one of 87 countries exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to the Atlantic Council.

MAS has been testing CBDCs and discussing the creation of multiple CBDC arrangements to improve the speed, cost and transparency of cross-border payments. It has developed a prototype multi-currency wholesale settlement network to enable the issuance and distribution of various CBDCs on a common network in partnership with China.

Nonfungible token

Singapore Art Week 2022, which ran from Jan. 14 through Jan. 23, hosted TZ APAC, which celebrated Asian digital artists in an industry-first nonfungible token (NFT) showcase at the S.E.A. Focus showcase.

ArtScience Museum in Singapore — the first museum in Asia with major exhibitions to integrate art, science, culture and technology — opened its newest exhibition, “Radical Curiosity: In the Orbit of Buckminster Fuller,” in conjunction with the final weekend of Singapore Art Week, according to Adrian George, director of programs, exhibitions and museum services at ArtScience Museum.

Known as the “grandfather of the future” by his admirers, Richard Buckminster Fuller was an American architect, systems theorist, inventor and author who predicted a technology similar to blockchain, on which cryptocurrency is based. In a video interview from 1967, Fuller states:

“I’ll have to talk about something which will be one of the very big, new realizations by 2000 AD, which will be a realistic scientific accounting system of what is wealth. [...] Wealth is energy.”

While ArtScience Museum did not offer NFTs of the “Radical Curiosity: In the Orbit of Buckminster Fuller” exhibition, here is one of Fuller created by Freeos and shared on Twitter:

2022-01-18,Crypto.com’s Stolen Ether Being Mixed Through Tornado Cash - CoinDesk,"Tornado Cash is a ETH mixer protocol that promises to improve transaction privacy by obscuring the on-chain link between the source and recipient of ether.

The protocol launched in early 2020.

On-chain data first spotted by security consultancy Peck Shield suggests that the 4,600 ether is being sent through the mixer in batches of 100 ether.

While some say that mixer protocols, or cryptocurrency tumblers, are used to protect the privacy of activists or other politically exposed individuals , they are often used to launder the proceeds of organized crime.

In a previous statement to CoinDesk, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said that mixers like Tornado Cash may fall under the definition of a money transmitter, and therefore have “obligations” set by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).

Law enforcement has previously shut down other mixers such as Bestmixer , which was raided by European Union authorities in 2019, and Helix, which was shut down by the FBI in 2021 for laundering Darknet funds.

Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm previously told CoinDesk in an interview that the protocol works with regulators to assuage their fears. Version 2 of Tornado Cash includes a cryptographic note in the transaction history of ether send through its pipes that can be used to determine fund provenance.

“We are in a little bit of a different situation [than other mixer wallets]. I think for us it’s very important to become compliant,” Storm previously told CoinDesk. “We do what we feel is right.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzAxLzE4L2NyeXB0b2NvbXMtc3RvbGVuLWV0aGVyLWJlaW5nLWxhdW5kZXJlZC12aWEtdG9ybmFkby1jYXNoL9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzAxLzE4L2NyeXB0b2NvbXMtc3RvbGVuLWV0aGVyLWJlaW5nLWxhdW5kZXJlZC12aWEtdG9ybmFkby1jYXNoLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-02-22,Why Fantom could be the cryptocurrency to take on Ethereum - The Face,"Contrary to what you might assume, Fantom is not a spooky typo. It’s actually a crypto network and coin (FTM, in the token’s case), which offers a lot of very interesting and different features to other blockchains. In fact, those features are so interesting that its potential could pose a real alternative to heavyweight coins such as Ethereum, Cardano and Solana. Founded in 2018 in South Korea, one of the minds behind Fantom is DeFi big shot Andre Cronje, who also works for Ethereum. Go figure.



What gives Fantom potential? Well, its network uses a DAG and a consensus that’s a variant on proof of stake (which they’ve called Lachesis). For the uninitiated, a consensus is the word for how the blockchain/​network validates transactions (computers mine crypto to reach a consensus, for example).



Fantom also has a couple of features that make it different to more known blockchains, both in terms of performance and what you can do on the network. But at the moment, Fantom is the 32nd most popular crypto by market cap, which would suggest it’s still pretty under the radar (can you name 32 cryptocoins?).



Has all of this gone over your head? Don’t stress. All will be explained below.

Lead artists Thomas and Maurice of Mitsi Studio ( https://mitsi.studio/portfolio/ ) in the Netherlands have designed for global brands like Nike, Redbull, Samsung, Adidas, Microsoft, Coca Cola, M&Ms, Mercedes, Porsche, and more.

Thomas Loopstra is the animation wizard. Tasked with one of the most challenging but important parts of any project, he breathes life into characters and environments. He excels in creating and maintaining an overall style throughout the team's work.



Maurice Baltissen is a 3D specialist whose aim is to deliver perfect illustrations and animations with incredible attention to detail. He’s constantly striving to break new ground visually, and to reach new heights in terms of the quality of his work. Global players and industry-leading brands have turned to the two European artists, who have now dedicated their work to a unique chance for personal investors and collectors to own a piece of their artwork.

2. Mind-Blowing Trailers

If you need an example, here’s their first two trailers:

Trailer 1 Trailer 2

More can be found both on their Instagram and on their website .

You can preview how the penguins will look in their full body, rendered and playfully animated.

3. Growing and Engaging Community

Their community is directly engaging and continuously growing. They gained over 100,000 discord members in less than a week, and are currently on pace to break 200,000 by mint.

4. Quality Merchandise

MPI aims to drop several high-quality penguin merch items, plushies, and clothing only accessible to holders and those who want to represent the project beyond the metaverse.

5. Introduction of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Since Penguins love to stay in a healthy and free community, MPI plans to introduce a DAO to make vital decisions for the island's development.

Each penguin's vote is equally important to the growth and evolution of the colony. Interactive specials have proven extremely intriguing among the NFT & crypto communities.

6. 3D Model in the Metaverse

After the upcoming launch in mid-February, each NFT holder will receive a digital 3D model of its penguin.

The model can be used to enter many existing NFT metaverses or be 3D printed. More so, holders will enjoy full intellectual property rights to their penguins.

Your Real Pet Furever.

The metaverse has grown immensely in 2021, with several DeFi projects successfully launching into the virtual world. One project that is pioneering real pets into the metaverse for the first time is ClassicDoge . It is a decentralized pet ecosystem with a social NFT marketplace for pet owners to connect with their pets. The team behind the project announced the ClassicDoge launch to allow pet owners to have a 3D digital representation of their pets in the virtual universe in the form of NFTs. This is the first project with real use cases developed for the pet industry.

ClassicDoge is leveraging blockchain technology and the metaverse to create a unique experience for pet lovers. According to the team, the project is not just for minting animal NFTs, but immortalizing those experiences shared with pets. The pet stays forever with the owner even at the advent of the loss of one’s beloved companion. In turn this will allow anyone to bring their pet with them furever in augmented reality for a walk again, or into the metaverse world of their choice. Through imminent and forthcoming partnerships ClassicDoge is integrating their technology into the top metaverse platforms to truly allow a pet owner to bring their pet with them everywhere they go virtually.

The DeFi platform is offering animal lovers the chance to own an NFT of their real pet, train to level up skills, purchase wearables and bring their pet with them, just like how it's done in the real world. Aside from that, owners can participate in events and missions with their pets for rewards and extend the bond existing between the pet and the owner.

Shaping the Petaverse by Bridging the Real World with Augmented & Virtual Reality

According to the team behind the project, two of the driving factors for creating ClassicDoge are enhancing the connection and interaction between the pet and it’s owner more than has ever been possible before . When owners lose their pets in the real world, they say goodbye to them for the last time, only left with precious memories. While the bond may still remain, there's no way to recollect all the beautiful memories and moments shared.

ClassicDoge ensures that pet owners don't have to grieve over the loss of their pets by helping them immortalize the animals in the metaverse. This involves minting the 3D scanned image of your pet into an NFT to enter the gateway of Furever, a pet centric metaverse. ClassicDoge will not only render the visual characteristics but the ability to include some behavioral traits of your pet, thus creating an open-ended memory forever, that you can engage with in a whole new way. With this, your pet gets to be with the owner forever with no end date.

Explore the petaverse with your companion in similar ways you would in real life. By interacting with your pet through VR / AR you can train your pet for skills such as: obedience, loyalty, intelligence, strength, stamina, endurance, passion. Even train your dog for specialized roles: rescue, exploration, security, hunting, helping, sledding and much more… Participate in events and games while unlocking new content and rewards all while increasing your rights and governance on the platform. Even accessorize your pet with limited edition content that can increase the value of your pet avatar and NFT.

By building the value of your pet, it can be added to already established metaverse marketplaces for purchase, or as an NFT in the Classicdoge Furever Marketplace for sale to bring royalties to the owner. As the value of your pet goes up, mate-a-pet will allow you to team up with other users to selectively breed for traits that you find desirable.

ClassicDoge Launches Its Digital Currency on PancakeSwap

ClassicDoge has already launched the public sale of its digital currency xDOGE on PancakeSwap. xDOGE will act as the currency of the NFT marketplace and virtual ecosystem, which will empower the users to purchase/sell pet avatars, NFTs, and accessories. The holders of xDoge will have the opportunity to participate in a DAO for voting rights within the community. ClassicDoge offers a staking platform for investors to earn while supporting the project, in addition xDoge will soon onboard new exchanges to boost awareness and offer more trading pairs.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jbGFzc2ljZG9nZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1pbmctcGV0LWludG8tbWV0YXZlcnNlLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-02-02,How DeFi 3.0 Adds Value To A Blockchain Ecosystem - Cryptonews,"How DeFi 3.0 Adds Value To A Blockchain Ecosystem

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

For many, decentralized finance, colloquially known as 'DeFi' is still a complex topic to navigate; however, through the help of community-focused initiatives, this is quickly changing. One such collective is the DeFi 3.0 Alliance , a non-profit association seeking to bring much-needed change to the DeFi sector. By pooling resources and experience from its members, the association wants to make DeFi 3.0 and Farming-as-a-Service (FaaS) a lot more transparent, usable, and affordable, ultimately ushering in widespread adoption.

The DeFi market, like most other offerings in the blockchain sector, has enormous potential and could blossom into one of the most potent aspects of this growing industry. With proper attention, DeFi 3.0 would become a crypto and blockchain lifeline that improves services for all involved stakeholders.

The journey to a successful DeFi 3.0 begins with individual players going the extra mile to ensure that their respective platforms provide outstanding service to users. This is what serves as the primary focus for Aggregated Finance (AGFI) , one of the founding members of the alliance. AGFI intends to use DeFi 3.0 to add value to the entire blockchain system through its easy-to-use operations and membership in the DeFi 3.0 association.

AGFI’s Approach to DeFi 3.0 and Blockchain

The Aggregated Finance platform takes several approaches to improving the blockchain ecosystem through DeFi. Launched in 2021, AGFI began its operations focused on pooling community investments into yield farms. This approach rewards backers and $AGFI token holders, especially as the platform’s earnings and treasury continue to increase. To ensure this increase, AGFI conducts thorough analysis before deciding how to allocate customer funds. AGFI also takes precautions by hedging its treasury with the USDC stablecoin when analyses foretell a possible downward market trajectory.

Aggregated Finance also controls $AGFI token inflation. The ecosystem regularly burns tokens to control available supply and regulate inflation as much as possible.

On top of that, AGFI also uses a 10% reflection mechanism to help grow the ecosystem. The platform repurposes the percentage tax collected in two major ways. Firstly, AGFI’s treasury wallet earns 5% for every transaction. This keeps the ecosystem much healthier by improving the liquidity pool. From the returned funds, AGFI will grow its alpha investments and reward community members through buybacks. In addition to the treasury funds, token holders will also earn rewards from the reflection tax on transactions.

AGFI also has an established decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that handles investments into other crypto projects. The DAO functions democratically, mirroring the opinions and desires of the AGFI community at large. For instance, the DAO will conduct periodic votes that allow the community to decide the best way to channel profits. This way, members of the platform can guarantee that investments and related actions would be in the best interest of all members.

AGFI currently has a market capitalization of just over USD 5 million, smaller than similar projects. Although these projects have valuations multiple times higher, they offer lower reflections, with some down to just 5%. On the other hand, AGFI has a higher reflection, and intends to increase its returns as trading volume grows, simultaneously growing the treasury fund and the rewards available to token holders.

Aggregated Finance has partnered with a decentralized identity solutions provider, Signata, to help infuse Decentralized Identity into AGFI’s upcoming Delegated Trader Services. Among other things, the Delegated Trader concept allows the community to vote on treasury decisions and investment implementations. In addition to identity solutions, Signata will also provide AGFI with security and custody services.

Perhaps the most notable advantage to AGFI is its membership in the DeFi 3.0 Alliance. Through the association, AGFI will invest in DeFi research and development for security standards in the sector. Furthermore, the alliance has an accelerator program for direct investment into new DeFi projects.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctZGVmaS0zMC1hZGRzLXZhbHVlLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tZWNvc3lzdGVtLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-02-23,Chingari set to start Web3 & Crypto revolution that you have been waiting for! - Hindustan Times,"Are you passionate about creating and sharing scroll-worthy videos? The award-winning Chingari app, which has taken the Internet by storm, is all set to become India’s most popular short video app as it allows you to create and share fun videos that can make you the centre of this universe.

That’s not all. You can also monetize the content you create leveraging the intelligence of Web 3.0. The winner of a month-long contest will be given the title of ‘Chingari Star’, who takes home special Chingari tokens, or $GARI, worth ₹1 crore.

Holders of Chingari’s social tokens stand to gain a lot more than just ‘social’ money. $GARI, the first-ever social token from Chingari, saw a record-breaking 24-hour trading volume of almost $100 million. The desi crypto-token gained ₹750 crore right on the day of its launch and is now on 20 major crypto platforms including HUObi Global, FTX, KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC Global, OKEx.

It is the first Indian social crypto-token to be listed on a global cryptocurrency market and is all set to usher in the Web3 revolution in the country. Chingari's $GARI aims to excel in the global block chain and crypto market environment with this benchmark. The token uses block chain technology, powered by Solana, to provide content creators with the ability to monetize their work on the Chingari platform. The app now has more than 110 million users, a figure that has doubled since 2020.

In line with the philosophy of the creators of the app, the set-up of the $GARI social token itself is totally democratic as the Chingari app is built on Web3, wherein Web3 DAO runs on decisions of the community. $GARI holders will be able to stake and earn yield as well as vote on proposals to decide the future direction of the platform.

“Giving creators much greater control has been a vital factor in the platform's rapid development, attracting talent and enhancing content quality as producers have a chance to make a livelihood. In addition, Chingari is also enabling the audience to earn with watch-2-earn, engage-2-earn and play-2-earn features on the Chingari app. $GARI acts both as an in-app currency (launched in Chingari App) and a governance token,” said Sumit Ghosh, Co-founder and CEO, Chingari app.

The $GARI social token is interconnected with the Chingari app, giving you direct control over your assets. You can use the tokens you collect through sharing your content or from prizes to transact with counterparties, place governance votes, and catalyse platform engagement and user base growth. Also, Chingari powered by $GARI will soon have its own NFT Marketplace, where the creators will be able to mint their videos and sell it as NFT and earn $GARI. So you have earned money while you are having fun making and sharing videos!

The $GARI social token is interconnected with the Chingari app, giving you direct control over your assets.

The special token is also being used by Chingari to allow more direct interactions with creators. Chingari is aiming to link brands directly with creators and is helping them monetize their content through $GARI tokens.

Launched in 2018, Chingari is a short video app that allows you to create and share fun videos – you can select a song from a massive library of free clips and sounds across genres, lip-sync and create a creative video to a selection of the song. You can also browse through thousands of scroll-worthy videos customised especially for you on topics ranging from food, fashion, DIY, ASMR, Memes.

You also have the option of picking a language of your choice from 20 languages including English, Hindi, Bangla, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Odia, Punjabi, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu to upload videos

It achieved its biggest success in 2020, when the app was recognised as the best app by the Government of India by winning the Atmanirbhar Bharat Best App award.

Chingari’s mission is to provide a platform where aspiring creators and young influencers can make a name for themselves, while building an audience and developing an online career. The aim is to boost the creators’ economy and for this, it has recently announced a huge contest called Chingari Star presented by KuCoin across India.

In October this year, Chingari's brand ambassador and investor, actor Salman Khan, launched $GARI. The app also recently announced the expansion of its $15 million Series A financing.

2022-03-29,KuCoin Co-Releases KCS Whitepaper with KCS Management ... - Business Wire,"VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KuCoin, the world-leading crypto exchange, has co-released the KCS Whitepaper in coordination with KCS Management Foundation and KCC, the decentralized public chain built by KuCoin’s fan communities and holders of KCS, KuCoin’s native token.

The KCS Whitepaper focuses on the scaling of the KCS ecosystem and summarizes the key collaborations around KCS and the KCS Management Foundation. The mechanisms designed to accelerate the value growth of KCS have been illustrated and the distribution plan of the 90 million KCS in lock-up has been clarified, in which 20 million KCS will be burned permanently.

The KCS Whitepaper also highlights KCS will build a payment system and a web3.0 ecosystem to empower KuCoin's web 3.0 strategy, by exploring and implementing the following areas: DIDs, NFT ownership rights, management and transaction, and construction of metaverse network platform.

The KCS Whitepaper outlines the focus of the KCS Management Foundation to serve as the governing entity responsible for the development, decision making, investment, and applications of KCS. The Foundation will cover research, funding, investment, incubation, and resource integration of the various projects it supports. The efforts of the Foundation will ultimately be aimed at progressing the advancement of decentralized technologies.

The Whitepaper also outlines the concept behind the distribution of the 90 million initial KCS lock-up. For the 25 million KCS held by the initial investors, 18 million will remain with the early investors and be released linearly over 5 years, another 7 million will be made as a donation to the KCS Management Foundation to further enrich the ecosystem. Of the 65 million KCS held by the founding team, 20 million will be burned for the first time permanently to accelerate the deflationary process of KCS. The mechanism is implemented to maintain price dynamics stable over the long term. 20 million will be used as long-term incentives for KCS holders and ecosystem contributors, and 25 million will be donated to the Foundation and gradually released in 5 years.

The price of KCS has seen a 2,000% increase since the beginning of 2021, which is further strengthened by the collaboration with KuCoin and the KCC communities.

KCS aims to build a blockchain-based value self-circulation ecosystem, where all KCS, KuCoin, and KCC community members will be empowered to access services and be incentivized by the extensive application scenarios built into the system. According to Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, “KCS will build a bridge between the centralized and decentralized world by connecting KuCoin and the KCC community, and lead the way for the creation of a self-circulation ecosystem with the community support and bring the blockchain from the geeks to the masses”.

KCS has also aligned with the KuCoin core team, the KCC GoDAO Foundation, investment institutions, angel investors, and representatives of the KCS Holder Community to co-establish the KCS Management Foundation. The latter will oversee the research, funding, investment, incubation, and resource integration of KCS and is currently working on the research and development of centralized and decentralized applications and various sectors of the blockchain economy. In the future, KCC GoDAO will replace the KCS Management Foundation to empower and facilitate the development of the KCS ecosystem.

Launched in 2021, KCC is becoming the birthplace of technological, business, and model innovation, and to create a complete closed-loop ecosystem of technology, products, and users. Its total TVL grows steadily and has reached 50 million in the first quarter of 2022.

2022-03-24,Almost half of Germans to invest in crypto: Report - Cointelegraph,"The richest country in Europe is coming round to crypto. That’s according to a report by KuCoin, which shared some flattering statistics towards the future of crypto in Deutschland.

Notably, 44% of Germans are “motivated to invest in cryptocurrencies to be a part of ‘the future of finance’” while over a third or “37% of German crypto investors have been trading cryptocurrencies for over a year.”

Cointelegraph had previously picked up on crypto’s impressive and productive year in Germany but it’s crucial to check the crypto sentiment on the ground.

Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin — the company publishing the report — explained to Cointelegraph the state of play of Germany' crypto investors:

""Cryptocurrencies are very popular among the supporters of the accumulation strategy, especially among the younger generation. They prefer to save for retirement on their own and diversify their savings through the use of cryptocurrencies.""

Lyu caveats that “despite the high demand for cryptocurrencies among Germans, the country does not yet have specific regulations that unequivocally regulate the use of digital money.”

Indeed, while Germany was the first country “to recognize that Bitcoins are ""units of value"" and could be classified as a 'financial instrument,’” according to the report. So far the local regulator has merely had ""some success in regulating crypto.""

However, Germany was the first country worldwide to adopt a blockchain strategy and interestingly, Germany’s political position relative to cryptocurrencies came up for discussion during recent parliamentary elections.

For Florian Döhnert-Breyer, managing director of F5 Crypto, “Germany is a role model for other EU countries, whose populations are generally more open to long-term investments.” Furthermore, ""As the largest country in the EU with a notoriously risk-averse view of financial assets, Germany has a special role to play."" He adds:

""The high number of women interested in crypto is particularly encouraging as this target group is, on average, less active in the financial market (e.g., stock market).”

The report states that “69% of crypto investors are men while women account for 53% of the crypto-curious,” which, according to Döhnert-Breyer, shows that women are more interested in the future of finance than legacy finance.

Katharina Gehra, CEO & co-founder of Immutable Insight, also picks up on the changing demographics of crypto investors: “Younger demographics show more self-directed and equity-focused investment style and are generally significantly more aware of inflations risks, in particular.”

However, the future remains uncertain, particularly regarding the regulatory environment, as “BaFin never tires to warn about the risks.” BaFin is the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority for Germany, responsible for regulating crypto. They recently gave the green light to neobank N26 to launch crypto trading in 2022.

Döhnert-Breyer is “confident that Germany will continue to pursue crypto-friendly legislation” while BaFin’s recent actions such as approving custody licenses and Bitcoin-based security tokens are promising signs. Germany may not have the same level playfield as “compared to Switzerland, UK,” says Gehra, but “there is some movement on the legislative side.”

Lyu has the last word:

“Last year, Germany took the first official step towards accepting crypto investments by approving special funds for investing in digital assets. I think the country has established a good bedrock to create a favorable climate for crypto users.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9hbG1vc3QtaGFsZi1vZi1nZXJtYW5zLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1jcnlwdG8tcmVwb3J00gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FsbW9zdC1oYWxmLW9mLWdlcm1hbnMtdG8taW52ZXN0LWluLWNyeXB0by1yZXBvcnQvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-26,PIX&TED Bank Transfer and Advcash are Now Supported on KuCoin - Business Wire,"VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has announced that it collaborated with Capitual to offer the PIX&TED payment services for BRL deposit and withdrawal in Brazil, and KuCoin also integrated Advcash to offer a new method for depositing and withdrawing assets onto user wallets. The addition is to be made with a focus on Eastern European and Latin American users.

KuCoin supports the Advcash service and Capitual, a channel company, to allow its users to buy digital assets using local currencies. The Advcash service is intended to cater to the growing Eastern European user base in the future, as well as markets in Asia Minor. The Capitual channel company will be directed at users from the Brazilian market, which has been experiencing considerable growth in adoption rates.

At present, the KuCoin exchange has completed the service integration testing of Advcash and Capitual, and provides smooth and stable services. The main purpose of the integration is to provide users of KuCoin with a higher degree of convenience in converting their local currencies into cryptocurrencies.

Capitual cooperates with local banks in Brazil that can support the PIX instant transfer system and TED regular transfers. The service relies on its native BRL token that users in Brazil can buy through PIX&TED and spend to purchase USDT. PIX is a system created by the Brazilian Central Bank for use with QR Codes, ensuring fast transfers and payments from one e-wallet to another in real-time.

“PIX is committed to bringing the fastest and most affordable deposit and withdrawal experience to KuCoin's Brazilian users,” as stated by Capitual product manager Bob Lee.

The main advantages of using Capitual as an add-on to KuCoin will include zero fees for use of PIX&TED when depositing BRL, instant payments, a high degree of security, and high upper limits of deposits at 1 million BRL in a single transaction.

Advcash is an easy-to-use and flexible payment system for users of UAH, USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, and BRL. The service can quickly and easily transfer money in multiple legal tender currencies to all countries, except those on the sanctioned list. Advcash allows users to take advantage of zero fees, round-the-clock support, high convenience and security via mandatory KYC2, and an upper limit of 1 million in the selected currency in a single deposit.

“Advcash is catering to KuCoin users by providing them with a high level of service and convenience when it comes to a variety of European currencies,” as Advcash product manager Jackson Lau commented on the integration.

KuCoin Spotlight platform inches closer to its 21st round: crypto holders will be able to be the first owners of Aurigami (PLY) tokens.

What is KuCoin?

Launched in 2017 by a heavy-hitting team of blockchain enthusiasts, KuCoin has established itself as a “people’s exchange” thanks to its unmatched user experience and client-centric approach.

Image by KuCoin

Currently, KuCoin is a top-tier altcoin exchange: it offers low-fee trading with 600+ assets and 1,100+ trading pairs. It delivers cryptocurrency services to more than 10 million users in 207 countries and regions across the globe.

KuCoin ecosystem includes various modules to ensure that a full stack of cryptocurrency services is available for clients under its hood. As of Q2, 2022, KuCoin clients can work with spot and marking trading dashboards, a peer-to-peer OTC module, a crypto-to-fiat paygate, staking and lending/borrowing services.

KuCoin is in the top 5 of centralized exchanges by trading volume; it also earned “Best Crypto Exchange and App” status by Motley Fool’s Ascent.

What is KuCoin Spotlight?

KuCoin Spotlight is a project launchpad platform for early-stage cryptocurrency products or blockchain projects .

Next-gen Token Launchpad

KuCoin Spotlight is designed to allow novel Web3 products to reach out to the wide audience of KuCoin. Every project that applies for listing on KuCoin Spotlight is evaluated by a professional team of 20+ experts. Four levels of research are performed by three separate teams.

Image by KuCoin Spotlight

Project-candidates are analyzed from almost 100 perspectives in six categories: project background, technical level, expertise of team members and advisors, financial status, marketing capability and external review are put under the microscope.

In all, less than 10% of projects are able to complete all checks successfully and get listed on KuCoin Spotlight. By the end of April, 2022, KuCoin Spotlight listed 20 tokens of high-quality products. The best-performing products (MEM, CWAR) completed token sales on KuCoin Spotlight with 780-920x ROI.

Introducing Spotlight Trial Fund

KuCoin backs its alumni with crowdfunding, marketing expertise and other types of support crucial for early-stage products.

The minimum threshold for participation in new token sales is set at 100 KCS (about $1,893 at press time). However, to lower the barrier to entry for newcomers, KuCoin Spotlight launched an additional mechanism of support dubbed Spotlight Trial Fund.

With this mechanism, users can take part in a number of specific activities on KuCoin Spotlight Platform to be eligible for the Spotlight ticket lottery even if their deposit is lower than 100 KCS.

Aurigami (PLY) token sale kicks off on KuCoin Spotlight

On April 29, 2022, KuCoin Spotlight is going to organize its 21st tokensale campaign. Now, it is set to introduce Aurigami project and its PLY token to a global community of crypto enthusiasts.

What is Aurigami?

Aurigami is a unique multi-purpose product focused on bridging the gap between Ethereum and NEAR: it is an EVM-compatible DeFi on NEAR Protocol. Rolled out on the top of Aurora, Aurigami is a decentralized, noncustodial service for crypto deposits and lending/borrowing operations.

Image by Aurigami

Aurigami allows lenders to earn passive income with highly competitive APYs while borrowers can benefit from over-collateralized assets.

Aurigami’s operations are gas-efficient thanks to contract optimization and a patented proprietary liquidation engine. Aurigami works with the eight most popular assets of the Aurora ecosystem. It has already established itself as one of the leading protocols on Aurora with $800 million in total value locked.

Project highlights

The initial token sale of PLY, the core native utility and governance cryptocurrency of Aurigami protocol, allows retail investors to purchase the token at the same valuation with a seed round. At the same time, there is no vesting on PLY for retail investors.

Previous rounds were co-led by Dragonfly Capital and Polychain Capital while Mechanism Capital, Amber Group, Coinbase Ventures and Jump Crypto also backed Aurigami in its fundraising efforts.

PLY’s circulating supply is controlled and balanced to prevent the token from deflation. Its progressive locking mechanism is designed to back liquidity mining programs and ensure healthy and sustainable tokenomics for PLY.

As per the product roadmap, in 2022, it is going to evolve into a full-stack DeFi ecosystem with liquidity pools, an innovation zone for early-stage products, isolated liquidity mechanisms and fixed lending rates. Also, Aurigami is planning to list TerraUSD, a red-hot stablecoin by the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem.

Tokenomics

The PLY token supply is capped at 10 billion tokens. A total of 19.5% of this supply will be released during the seed round, while 19% will be locked for team members.

Forty percent of PLY will be allocated to fuel liquidity mining activities, an additional 4% will be used for liquidity provisioning features, and 12.5% will be locked for treasury and ecosystem needs.

Also, 5% of the PLY supply will be distributed among the 21th KuCoin Spotlight participants.

Starting from May 5, 2022, PLY token will be listed on KuCoin in pairs with the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), and the largest stablecoin, U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT)How to participate on KuCoin Spotlight: Manual

In order to take part in token sale on the KuCoin Spotlight platform, traders should enter the “Earn” section and choose the “Spotlight” projects. Here, the PLY token of Aurigami project should be selected.

Then, traders will be asked to go through a three-step verification progress. They should pass advanced KYC checks (KYC-2, in terms of KuCoin), confirm that they do not represent restricted jurisdictions and approve the “Purchase Agreement” in digital form.

That’s it: by clicking “Participate Now,” users submit their applications for participation. If the application is successful, the status of users’ request automatically changes to “Participated Successfully.”

The application campaign for PLY token sale opens on April 29, 2022, at 12:00 a.m. UTC, with a starting issue price of $0.005. And will remain open until May 5 (12:00 a.m. UTC). Tokens will be distributed between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. UTC on May 5.

The KuCoin team released infographics to display the registration process for the token sale.

Bottom line

KuCoin Spotlight is an initial token sale platform of the “people’s exchange,” KuCoin, one of the most influential CEXes in crypto. It is set to introduce selected early-stage products to retail investors providing average crypto users with VC-level investing opportunities.

Aurigami (PLY), an Aurora-based DeFi protocol, is chosen as the 21st KuCoin Spotlight product. It leverages EVM-compatible money markets on NEAR Protocol and supports all cutting-edge DeFi instruments.

2022-03-14,From lines of code on a laptop to international crypto exchange: The story behind KuCoin - Cointelegraph,"Behind KuCoin’s creation, there are two tech geeks who were early blockchain adopters. Having started coding at the age of eight and founded his first startup at 16, in 2012, Michael heard about Bitcoin (BTC) from his boss Eric at a private equity investment firm, IDG Capital, and immediately began mining. While he tried to sell some Bitcoin on the Mt.Gox exchange, which was the world’s largest trading platform at the time, he discovered how difficult it was for beginners to navigate.

By the end of 2013, realizing the potential of crypto, Michael and Eric wrote the first code at a cafe. In 2017, they decided to focus on their venture full time and created the “People’s Exchange,” KuCoin.

Cointelegraph talked to Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, about the struggles and successes of running one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges.

How did KuCoin change over time?

Following KuCoin’s rapid growth, we received $20 million in funding from IDG Capital and Matrix Partners in 2018. In 2019, we launched innovative products, such as KuCoin 2.0, Spotlight, KuCoin Futures, Earn (formerly known as Pool-X) and Margin Trading. These have propelled KuCoin from a crypto exchange that only has spot trading services to a platform that offers a diverse range of crypto financial services.

We are constantly innovating our products. As a result, we now offer over 640 tradable assets, have become a veritable Top 1 Altcoin Exchange, and rank among the top five on CoinMarketCap. Forbes Advisor has named KuCoin the best cryptocurrency trading platform in the world in 2021.

In 2022, The Ascent, a Motley Fool service, named KuCoin the Best Cryptocurrency Apps for Enthusiasts.

What is the most difficult struggle the exchange had to overcome and how did it do it?

I think the most significant difficulty for an exchange, or a crypto company, is balancing and allocating the company’s limited resources — whether to invest more in R&D to develop more products or to invest more in marketing and sales to gain a larger market share.

At one point, KuCoin faced this dilemma. After the crypto industry entered a bearish market in 2018 and the sector slowed down, we were faced with two choices: to increase investment in market expansion or to get ready for the long term by improving its infrastructure and bolstering the team.

KuCoin ultimately chose the latter. Since then, we have launched an entirely new line of innovative products.

What is KuCoin’s biggest achievement so far?

KuCoin has been moving toward facilitating the global free flow of digital value as well as getting everyone involved with crypto since its inception.

More insights from KuCoin here

In the past four years of development, we have gone from a founding team of seven people to almost 600 employees all over the globe and over 10 million registered users, serving users in more than 200 countries and regions worldwide.

Behind these numbers is the trust and support of every KuCoin user, and I think this is KuCoin’s most valuable asset and our most outstanding achievement.

What kind of updates and products should KuCoin users expect this year?

This year, as a Top 1 Altcoin exchange, we will be mining more crypto gems, exploring and experimenting more with social trading and social trading features.

KuCoin’s decentralized ecosystem has developed over time, and we have achieved results in a number of areas, including public chains, wallets, nonfungible tokens (NFT) and GameFi. Next, we will further expand KuCoin’s decentralized ecosystem.

On the one hand, we plan to offer users more decentralized products, such as our decentralized trading solutions. As a member of the KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) public chain KCC, we will also promote its further development. On the other hand, we will also expand KuCoin’s reach in the decentralized field, especially in the metaverse, Web3 and other essential areas in the future. In addition, we will work to further build a broader and more diverse ecosystem through incubation, investment and acquisitions.

It looks like the crypto industry is in a bear market, with some voicing opinions about potential “crypto winter.” How do you think it’ll influence the development and adoption of the crypto industry, given the interest we’ve seen over the past two years?

First, I think the crypto market is in a correction rather than in a bearish market. Secondly, I look at the market downturn from a developmental perspective. Short-term lows are necessary for developing things and contributing to long-term growth.

A brief downturn is actually conducive to the long-term growth of an industry. In the past two years, the space has experienced rapid development. The entry of many traditional funds has caused a lot of disruption within the industry. After the market has calmed down, only projects with real value and potential that focus on technological innovation and application survive.

What can traders and investors do to minimize losses when markets are unstable?

I don't usually give any trading advice because I'm more of a “hodler” than a trader. In general, at all times, investors should put their money within the range of what they can afford to lose.

This is particularly important as we enter a correction period where market uncertainty increases. Investors should increase the fault tolerance of their investments by reducing their leverage to ensure that even if they misjudge the market’s direction, they have enough time and capital to correct that mistake.

2022-04-13,KuCoin's Into The Cryptoverse Report reveals 35% of Nigerian ... - TechCabal,"KuCoin, a world-leading cryptocurrency exchange, has released its Into The Cryptoverse Report covering cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption in Nigeria, revealing that Nigerians are embracing cryptocurrencies due to limited access to affordable financial services. Cryptocurrencies are thus becoming an alternative solution for the storage and transfer of assets.

The report reveals important statistics regarding the involvement of the local population in cryptocurrency, including that 33.4 million Nigerians—which accounts for 35% of the population aged 18 to 60—currently own cryptocurrencies, or have traded cryptocurrencies over the past 6 months. Fifty-two percent of Nigerian crypto investors allocate over half of their assets to cryptocurrencies, and 65% make fiat deposits to cryptocurrencies via peer-to-peer trading. Another important finding is that 70% of Nigerian crypto investors intend to increase their cryptocurrency investments over the next 6 months, giving reasons to believe that digital asset adoption in the country is accelerating.

The KuCoin Into The Cryptoverse report on Nigeria showcases that cryptocurrencies are becoming an important financial instrument in the African country as a means of payment and value storage, in times of economic hardship. Global interest in blockchain technology and its adoption is growing, and more than 80% of central banks are considering launching a Central Bank digital currency (CBDC), or have already done so. Nigeria tops the retail CBDC leaderboard with the eNaira as it launched its own digital currency in October 2021. This has increased interest in and the adoption of decentralised currencies in the whole country.

Such rates of adoption can be attributed to the fact that the Nigerian currency, the naira, has depreciated by over 209% in the past 6 years, despite the Central Bank of Nigeria’s desperate attempts to keep the exchange rate afloat.

According to the KuCoin survey, 37% of crypto investors in the country started trading cryptocurrencies more than 3 years ago, with 6% of the aforementioned starting to do so more than 6 years ago. With national inflation rates climbing to their highest point since 2008, the challenging economic climate in Nigeria was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, making cryptocurrencies an attractive alternative source of income, particularly in the bullish market in 2021. Such reasons are backed by the findings in the report, which reveal that 26% of surveyed crypto investors reportedly started trading cryptocurrencies over the past 6 months.

The high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies also showed gender parity in crypto investment, as the survey revealed that women account for 50% of crypto investors, on par with men. The breakdown of reasons for investment reveals that 53% of crypto investors consider cryptocurrencies a reliable value-storage and payment means; 50% invest to gain higher returns in the long run; 40% attempt to start their own businesses and improve their living conditions; 36% invest for an additional source of income to their salaries; and 34% strive to achieve financial independence, and 26% hope to rely on cryptocurrencies as their main source of income without having to work additionally.

The survey also suggests that Nigerian crypto investors allocate an average of 60% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, followed by cash/bank deposits (20%) and foreign currencies (7%), and other instruments. Fifty-two percent of Nigerian crypto investors allocate over half of their investments to cryptocurrencies, while so-called “super crypto investors”, which account for 22% of total crypto investors in the country, allocate over 90% of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency adoption rate increases in Nigeria are also evident from the previous report, according to KuCoin data, which identified that the average number of monthly transactions across African countries has shown a 1,386.7% increase from January 2021 to January 2022, with the number of users also showing a 2,467.2% spike over the same period.

Blockchain technology is predicted to potentially add $1.76 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Cryptocurrency provides an easier banking solution to traditional banks thereby improving financial inclusion. It also provides an alternative and affordable source for diaspora remittance, which plays a huge part in the Nigerian and African economy. The potential success of Nigeria’s eNaira and increased crypto adoption shows the importance of the crypto market to the economy, and it’ll likely spur cryptocurrency development and adoption in other countries where financial inclusion is a key desired outcome.

This report on Nigeria showcases that cryptocurrencies are becoming an important financial instrument in the African country in times of economic hardship as a means of payment and value storage.

2022-03-30,KuCoin KCS Whitepaper and Token Burn News - Cryptonews,"KuCoin KCS Whitepaper and Token Burn News

Disclaimer: The following article is part of Cryptonews Deals Series and was written as a promotional article in collaboration with the sponsor of this offer. If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let’s build together.

You may have heard of KuCoin Shares ( KCS ), the native token of cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. But if you’re interested in owning it, especially if you want to know how you, as a potential owner, can benefit from this token, KuCoin has made it easier than ever: by publishing a KCS Whitepaper , together with the KCS Management Foundation, that outlines exactly what the future holds in store for KCS. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a rundown of everything important here — and if you’re still not convinced, we may just help you change your mind.

What Does the KCS Whitepaper Bring?

In short, the KCS whitepaper brings one much-needed thing to the space: clarity. But to be precise, let’s go through all the news outlined there so you can immediately find what you want to know (but be sure to read the original for full details).

The first, and arguably most important, thing that the whitepaper addresses is the distribution plan of the 90m KCS that are currently in lock-up. This includes a token burn of 20m KCS — permanently, as part of their strategy to drive up the value of the remaining KCS tokens. Out of the 25m KCS held by initial investors, 18m will be slowly released over a period of five years, while the remaining 7m will be donated to the KCS Management Foundation. The burned amount comes from the total of KCS 65m belonging to the founding team; KCS 20m will be used as long-term incentives for contributors, while KCS 25m will be donated to the Foundation and gradually released in 5 years.

Generally speaking, token burning is an activity most often used for deflationary purposes, to either keep the value of a token at the same level — evading inflation, in other words — or even to increase its value. There is no telling which of these might happen (if there were, getting rich would be much easier than it is!), but in the case of KCS, the token itself has seen a 2,000% increase since the beginning of 2021. At the time of writing, it was trading at USD 21.42 per token, having reached its all time high in December 2021, when it rose up to USD 28.80.

That’s Not All There Is!

While tokenomics tend to be the part traders and/or holders are most interested in, they’re far from the only aspect addressed in the new whitepaper. There is also a plan outline of what the KCS Management Foundation will be up to: as the governing entity responsible for the development, decision making, investment, and applications of KCS, it aims to ultimately help progress the advancement of all decentralized technologies. As of right now, it covers research, funding, investment, incubation, and resource integration of the various projects it supports, making it an invaluable resource for up-and-coming projects in the ecosystem.

Ultimately, the KCS project wants to build a blockchain-based value self-circulation ecosystem, serving as a bridge between the centralized and decentralized world by connecting KuCoin and the KuCoin Core (KCC) community. With the goal of true decentralization in mind, the KCS Management Foundation will be replaced by the KCC GoDAO in the future.

2022-03-25,How to Transfer USDT from KuCoin to Bybit? - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

KuCoin and Bybit are two exchanges that are popular among cryptocurrency investors

In this article, we are going to explain the process of transferring Tether (USDT) from KuCoin to Bybit

We'll be providing a step-by-step guide and address the most common questions users have about the process

Transferring funds between different crypto exchanges is a very common process for many cryptocurrency investors. In this article, we will be showing you how to transfer USDT from KuCoin to Bybit.

Users transfer funds from one exchange to another one for various reasons. Maybe, you want to buy an Altcoin that is only available on a particular exchange or you want to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity. Some exchanges don't accept fiat, so you might have to transfer funds to an exchange that supports fiat pairs.

What is KuCoin?

KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange that lists a large number of different altcoins, which has made it a popular choice among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The exchange was founded in 2017 and initially offered a simple platform for cryptocurrency spot trading. Over the years, KuCoin has expanded its suite of features, and now also supports more advanced features like margin and derivatives trading, crypto lending and token sales. The exchange puts a lot of emphasis on welcoming all types of cryptocurrency investors, ranging from beginners to seasoned veterans.

What is Bybit?

Bybit is a popular Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange that features both derivatives and spot markets. The exchange is available globally, although some jurisdictions are excluded (perhaps most notably, Bybit is not available to customers in the United States). Bybit started off as a derivatives exchange, but now offers a full suite of products which includes passive income products, Launchpad token sales, peer-to-peer trading, and more. This has helped the exchange grow its usersbase, and Bybit now serves millions of users across the globe.

Create Bybit Account

Step-by-step guide

Sending cryptocurrency from KuCoin to Bybit is a relatively straightforward process, as long as you keep a few important points in mind. We'll be providing a step-by-step guide that will hopefully answer any questions you might have about the process.

1. Get your USDT deposit address on Bybit

If you want to send USDT to your Bybit account, you will first have to find your Bybit USDT deposit address. After logging in to your Bybit account, go to the “Assets” section and select “Spot Account”.

You will see a list of all the coins listed on the exchange. USDT should be near the top of the list, but you can find it with the search bar if you don’t spot it right away. Select the “Deposit” option next to USDT.

The USDT token is available on many different blockchains. However, you cannot directly send USDT from one blockchain (for example Ethereum) to a different blockchain (for example TRON). Let's say that you have TRON-based USDT - in order for the transaction to be successful, the tokens must be sent to another address on the TRON blockchain.

Pay close attention to the chain type that you select, as it must match the chain type that you will be selecting on KuCoin. ERC20, TRC20, and OMNI are the available chains for USDT on Bybit. TRC20 is the preferred option for many users, because it offers fast and cheap transactions.

In most cases, you will want to receive deposits to your Spot account on Bybit. If you want to customize this option, you can do so by selecting ""Modify"" in the deposit window.

2. Withdraw USDT from KuCoin

If you are using a web browser, log in to your KuCoin account and go to the ""Withdraw"" section. There's a search box on this page and you will be able to find USDT there.

Now, you have to enter your USDT address (the address you received from Bybit) and select the proper chain. The blockchain type should match the blockchain you selected on Bybit. Finally, you have to click confirm to complete the withdrawal process. Then, you will have to provide your trading password, email verification code and, 2FA code.

For more information regarding the withdrawal process from KuCoin, refer to this link.

3. Check your deposit on Bybit

The USDT deposit should be available in your Bybit account after a few network confirmations, which usually takes a couple of minutes. The deposit will be added to your “Assets” and visible under your “Spot Account”. If you chose to auto-channel the deposit to your Derivatives Account, you will be able to find it there. You can also check out the Tronscan block explorer to track the transaction on the TRON blockchain.

Closing thoughts

Many users are concerned about the security of transferring cryptocurrency from one crypto exchange to another. The process is actually not that complicated, and you only have to pay attention to a few details, such as making sure you are sending funds on the correct blockchain. If you are transferring an amount of funds that's significant to you, we recommend that you first perform a test transfer between the two exchanges with a small amount of funds just to see that everything is working correctly.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzOTk5L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20ta3Vjb2luLXRvLWJ5Yml0L9IBUWh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzOTk5L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20ta3Vjb2luLXRvLWJ5Yml0Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-04-12,"Report: Over A Third of Nigerians Are Invested in Bitcoin, Crypto - Nasdaq","KuCoin released Into The Cryptoverse, a report showing 35% of Nigerians aged 18-60 are invested in or trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

KuCoin conducted a report with multiple surveys that shows 35% of the adult population aged 18-60 in Nigeria are vested in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

The investor class is largely made up of a youthful population driven by Nigeria’s median age of 18.4 years old, which leads to 52% of the investors being below the age of 30.

Nigeria hosts many long-term investors in the space as its currency, the Naira, has seen a 209% depreciation over a six-year period. 37% of investors in the space have been invested for over 3 years.

KuCoin, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, recently released a report titled “Into The Cryptoverse” where they discussed the penetration of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into populations of varying countries. Most notable among them is Nigeria; 35%, or 33.4 million, of its adults aged 18-60 owned or traded bitcoin or some form of cryptocurrency in the last 6 months.

Users With Internet Access

This staggering amount of 35% of adults becomes even more bewildering when one recognizes that as of January 2022, only 51% of the entire population of Nigeria has access to the internet, according to the report. Of that 51% of the population, 86% of Nigerian internet users are familiar with cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle. The report also states that according to Google Trends, Nigeria hosted the highest number of searches for Bitcoin in early 2021.

A survey conducted of the penetrated 35% shows that 70% of those users intend to increase their holdings within a short period of time. Another 6% of the population not currently invested were surveyed and said they are interested in investing within the next six months.

Youthful Investor Interest Grows as Naira Falls

Over a course of six years, Nigeria’s currency, Naira, has depreciated 209%, according to the report. The adoption rate of Bitcoin is far more substantial in populations that have a need for Bitcoin, rather than just a want for it. The failing Naira led to earlier adoption that most, as 37% of those currently involved in bitcoin have been invested or trading in the asset for more than 3 years, with another 27% having just started within the past 6 months.

A need to opt out of the existing structure is being driven by the youthful population of Nigeria as its median age sits at 18.4 years old, according to Statista cited in the report. This drives the statistic in which 52% of Nigerians invested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under the age of 30.

Gender Parity Among Investors of Nigeria

One interesting statistic KuCoin uncovered in a survey of those currently vested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies showed 50% gender parity. Nigeria seems to be proving that when economic need, youth of a population, and innovation collide, gender plays no role in the adoption of an emergent monetary system.

Nigeria’s Long-Term Investor Outlook

Low-time preference seems molded with entrepreneurial spirit in Nigeria with 62% of investors believing this emerging system is the future of finance and 50% of investors saying they are in it for the long run. 40% of investors look to use their gains to start a business, 36% are looking for another revenue stream, and 26% seek to rely on their investment as primary income.

Portfolio Diversification

The portfolio diversification, or the lack of diversification in some cases, is a fascinating statistic among Nigerian investors. On average, these investors allocate 60% to cryptocurrency, 20% to cash or bank deposits, and 7% to foreign currencies with additional financial instruments closing the gap, which means over 52% of investors are allocating over half of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies, according to the report.

A little over one-fifth of these investors (22%) store over 90% of their assets in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. This minority group tends to be slightly older and less familiar with other financial products with a focus on money transfers and transactions, rather than trading.

Conclusion

As of February 2022, 65% of these investors utilize peer-to-peer trading to deposit fiat for cryptocurrencies after the Central Bank of Nigeria barred banks from enabling crypto transactions in February 2021, according to another survey conducted by KuCoin cited in the report.

Further KuCoin data shows a 1,386.7% increase in monthly transactions across African countries from January 2021 - January 2022. During the same period, active users also increased by 2,467.2%.

Countries like Nigeria showcase the need of a new monetary system that allows cross-border payments with minimal fees and global access in its most reliable form. The central authorities of Nigeria have failed to properly care for its citizenry and its youthful population has taken it upon themselves to enforce needed change. While bitcoin certainly serves as a store-of-value for many in more developed places of the world, the humanitarian and altruistic use cases of Bitcoin are what truly make it inevitable.

2022-03-21,"KuCoin: Crypto users in Africa grew by 2,500% in 2021 - Nairametrics","The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Africa has been a topic of interest in the cryptocurrency community, with many cryptocurrency analytic firms showing different projections and estimates of how much Africans are using these new asset classes.

A positive report by cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin reveals that cryptocurrency transactions increased by over 2,500% in 2021. The report however reveals that the number of crypto transactions in Africa constitutes roughly 2.8% of global volumes.

The report claims that both private and public organizations are increasing their investments in Research and Development (R&D), in order to create the conditions for the adoption of the asset class. It reads, “Local public and private enterprises are increasing their investments in R&D, while creating the necessary bedrock for the establishment of the next generation of information and communication technologies. Most African countries have adopted bold policies aimed at building economies centered around modern technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrencies.”

What you should know

The report reveals that the average number of monthly transactions across African countries has shown a 1,386.7% increase from January 2021 to January 2022.

The report also states that the number of users has also increased significantly, showing a 2,467.2% spike over the same period.

The average amount per transaction has decreased, which the report states that it indicates, “that the adoption of this technology is taking place not only for large transfers, but for small payments as well.”

The report attributed the massive growth in adoption to the high level of inflation seen in African countries. It states, “the adoption of crypto technologies in Africa were preceded by the availability of the technology and the presence of several motivating factors. These include the desire of the population to react quickly to any changes in the exchange rate of national currencies in countries with high rates of inflation and devaluation.”

It further reads, “The possibility of quickly transferring investments across assets mitigates the chance of savings depreciation. Not all countries are as inflationary as those of Sudan (260%) or Ethiopia (66%). Still, the desire to preserve the purchasing power, even under 6.4% inflation (Tunisia), is natural for those seeking to preserve the value of their savings.”

The report reveals that more than 88.5% of cryptocurrency transactions made by Africans are cross-border transfers and they turn to cryptocurrencies due to low transaction fees. It further reads, “In many cases, users pay less than 0.01% of the overall amount of the transaction transferred in cryptocurrencies. This simultaneously solves several issues associated with crypto transaction restrictions that are in place in countries like Nigeria and Kenya. End-users of services can conduct transactions in a matter of milliseconds without fear of temporary freezes of transferred funds, as is often the case with conventional payment systems.”

The report claims that Cape Town and Lagos are the powerhouses of the digitalization process in Africa. It reads, “Cairo, Cape Town and Lagos can be considered the engines of the digitization process in the region. Kenya is a separate area of focus in East Africa, with the number of cryptocurrency transactions in Nairobi — its capital — being 64% higher than in the rest of the region.”

Nourou, founder of Bitcoin Senegal, is convinced that the thousand percent growth rates for Bitcoin (BTC) adoption “will continue in coming years.” He states, “Take a look at the way in which cars, mobile phones and consumer electronics took off on the continent. Africa is a continent where lightning-fast progression and adoption is common.”

The report concluded by stating, “With the proper legislative attention and acceptance of the need for such digital technologies by the authorities, crypto platforms could be an effective steppingstone for the overall growth of Africa’s GDP.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzIxL2t1Y29pbi1jcnlwdG8tdXNlcnMtaW4tYWZyaWNhLWdyZXctYnktMjUwMC1pbi0yMDIxL9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzIxL2t1Y29pbi1jcnlwdG8tdXNlcnMtaW4tYWZyaWNhLWdyZXctYnktMjUwMC1pbi0yMDIxLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-03-20,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, KuCoin Token, and Quant Daily Price Analysis ... - Cryptopolitan","TL;DR Breakdown The global crypto market lowers its value, shedding 1.15% in 24 hours.

Bitcoin is also bearish, shedding 0.43% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum also changes direction, shedding 2.38%.

KuCoin Token is in loss as it shed 1.42% while Quant gained 0.24%.

The global crypto market couldn’t retain the previous gains as the bearish trend dominated. The change came after the speeding addition in the value of top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major names. The weekend didn’t prove fruitful for the market as it couldn’t get what it aimed at. The market cap value was expected to increase or retain the recent high, but it couldn’t do either.

Analysts predict that Bitcoin, Luna, Avalanche, etc., are some coins that might see a bullish trend in the coming week. The previous week proved productive for many of these, and if the following one retains the same spirit, it will be much more productive for investors. The main point for coins in the current situation is to gain momentum as they might gain value, but whether they would be able to maintain the momentum is the question.

El Salvador was one of the top countries for crypto adoption in 2021. Its process of crypto adoption has lowered since then. The start of it was too optimistic for the investors and the government because Bitcoin was going high at a faster pace. The lag in value gains has affected the investors and the government. It is yet to be seen how this policy will proceed.

Here is a brief overview of the current market situation using the performance of currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some others.

BTC in the reverse gear

Bitcoin was moving faster this week, but the gains have come to a halt, and the recent stats tell of a lag in value. Instead of new gains, there is a depreciation in its value seen. One of the significant factors that have affected its progress is its inability to cross $42K this weekend, as many investors expected it.

The data for the last 24 hours shows that Bitcoin shed 0.43% over the last 24 hours. While in comparison, its weekly performance was much better. The gains for the last seven days were about 7.13%. The latest stats show a decrease in its price, which has come down to the $41,552.42 range.

The market cap value for Bitcoin is estimated to be $788,456,398,647. While the 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is estimated to be $21,242,427,579. The same amount in its native currency is 511,591 BTC.

ETH lowers value

Ethereum has lowered the value of gains as its rivals saw a rise in bullishness. Ethereum is considered one of the favorites for the upcoming week because of its performance. Its position and value also make it the best choice for investors in the market after Bitcoin.

The data for the past 24 hours shows that Ethereum depreciated 2.38%. In comparison, it could clinch gains of 12.43% over the last seven days. Its weekly graph shows a slow decline in value after the sell-offs ensued. The current price for Ethereum is in the $2,878.89 range.

The market cap value for Ethereum is estimated to be $345,573,938,408. The 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is estimated to be $12,282,101,254.

KCS drops value

KuCoin has seen a drop in value at the weekend as it couldn’t maintain the momentum. The change in value has resulted in a loss of 1.42% over the last 24 hours. The last seven days were normal for it as it bagged 1.54%. The reason for it is the fluctuating pattern for this coin.

The weekly chart for this coin shows that it remained volatile and didn’t gain much value. The current price for KuCoin Token is in the $18.22 range. While the current market cap value for this coin is estimated to be $1,459,974,371.

The trading volume of this coin is about $5,058,743. The circulating supply of it remained 80,118,638 KCS.

QNT continues bullish

Quant retained gains as it continued bullish over the last 24 hours. Its gains remained 0.24%, while the weekly performance shows gains of 2.79%. The current price for this coin is in the $118.32 range.

The current market cap value for Quant is estimated to be $1,428,482,986. In comparison, the 24-hour trading volume remained $41,132,923—the same amount in the native currency of this coin, 347,632 QNT.

The circulating supply of Quant remained at 12,072,738 QNT. The chart for this coin shows a short interval of bullishness and then a decrease in value.

Final Thoughts

The global crypto market has receded in value due to ensuing bearishness in the market. The value of the global crypto market has reduced to $1.87T over the weekend. The decrease is from $1.89T, which was the market cap value as per the recent estimates on the last day. The market might gain momentum further as experts predict bullishness for Bitcoin and some altcoins. It will also impact the other coins as Bitcoin can push the whole market.

2022-03-09,The future of work: Companies open offices in the metaverse - Cointelegraph,"There’s been a sharp decline in interest for the “metaverse” keyword in Google search. However, while the hype may be waning, it seems that companies are still very keen on dipping their toes into the virtual world.

In March alone, companies have either launched or revealed plans to build metaverse offices that would be used for online meetings with international clients, internal innovation hubs and enhancing social communication with users.

While we may be witnessing its earlier versions, metaverse offices seem like a sneak peek into the future of work. With this, let’s take a look at some companies that have recently entered the metaverse.

Events firm Atom sets up a metaverse office

Atom, an events firm based in Mumbai, has recently set up its metaverse office. The firm purchased digital space in Decentraland, and it’s planning to use the virtual office as a new way to reach out to its international clients. The company also plans to use it for future metaverse events.

Yash Kulshreshtha, the creative head for Atom, said in an interview that the move aims to expand the company’s global operations and cater to younger generations. “The young generation growing up today will find it completely natural,” said Kulshreshtha.

2022-03-07,Cryptocurrency companies resist pressure to close Russian accounts - CBS News,"Additional U.S. sanctions target Putin's inner circle as lawmakers call for ban on Russian oil imports

U.S. banks, oil companies and internet service providers are cutting off Russia's access to their services following its invasion of Ukraine, and the list of other companies doing the same grows daily. But one rapidly growing industry so far has declined to pull back in Russia: cryptocurrency traders.

Unlike other financial institutions, crypto exchanges have so far chosen not to suspend service to their customers in Russia. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a series of tweets last week that ""ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline"" after the ruble's value plummeted as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia. Shutting down Coinbase's trading platform in Russia would hurt ordinary Russians, many of whom don't support the war, he said.

""We are not preemptively banning all Russians from using Coinbase,"" Armstrong tweeted. ""We believe everyone deserves access to basic financial services unless the law says otherwise.""

8/ Some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed. Many of them likely oppose what their country is doing, and a ban would hurt them, too. That said, if the US government decides to impose a ban, we will of course follow those laws. — Brian Armstrong - barmstrong.eth (@brian_armstrong) March 4, 2022

The crypto world was thrust into the global spotlight days after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, as investors across the globe donated millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency to the Ukrainian government in a show of support. Russian investors, meanwhile, are ditching the ruble and converting to bitcoin following a plunge in the Russian currency's value as economic sanctions take hold.

Coinbase joins Kraken, KuCoin and Coinberry and other crypto exchanges that said they will not block Russian customers from using their platforms. The platforms argue that blocking ordinary citizens runs contrary to their crypto-isn't-tie-to-a-government appeal.

""Crypto is meant to provide greater financial freedom for people across the globe,"" Binance said in a a statement last month. ""To unilaterally decide to ban people's access to their crypto would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists.""

Can Russia use crypto to avoid sanctions?

Armstrong's comments came as U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that the Russian government will use cryptocurrency to circumvent economic sanctions targeting a slew of Russian financial institutions, including its Central Bank.

But it's unlikely Russia can use crypto to evade sanctions, said Yesha Yadav, a Vanderbilt University law professor and expert in financial technology regulation. The Russian economy is too large and there's not enough efficiency on the blockchain — the technological platform for digital currencies —to convert rubles into cryptocurrency at a scale large enough to prop up the economy, Yadav told CBS MoneyWatch.

The U.S. government hasn't ordered American crypto companies to block their Russian customers, Yadav noted that the current U.S. Treasury directive doesn't require crypto exchanges to block all Russian IP addresses. But that could change in coming weeks now that the U.S. Justice Department has created a task force that will explore possible restrictions on crypto trading with Russia, she said.

While ordinary Russian citizens will continue to have access to Coinbase, Binance and the others, those exchanges also said they will freeze the trading activity of any Russian national that the U.S. places on its sanctions list, including Russian oligarchs.

""That being said, we don't think there's a high risk of Russian oligarchs using crypto to avoid sanctions,"" Armstrong tweeted. ""Because it is an open ledger, trying to sneak lots of money through crypto would be more traceable than using U.S. dollars cash, art, gold, or other assets.""

A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that sanctioned Russians will be blocked, but declined to say who or how many people on the sanctions list have Coinbase accounts. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a blog post Friday that the Singapore-based company has booted one sanctioned person, whose identity was not disclosed, off its platform.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY29pbmJhc2UtYmluYW5jZS1mcmVlemUtYWNjb3VudHMtcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmUv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvY29pbmJhc2UtYmluYW5jZS1mcmVlemUtYWNjb3VudHMtcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

As nations worldwide continue to sanction Russia in condemnation of their invasion of Ukraine, companies have now joined the movement to exclude the Russian government – and sometimes Russians – from their list of clients. Some of these companies have decided to ban them following international sanction provisions from The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

by Alex Malyshev, CEO, SDK.finance

Others have taken this decision as a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people. However, not all FinTech companies are placing blanket boycotts on Russian citizens. The most notable holdouts are Binance and Kraken, citing the argument that banning “innocent Russians” goes against the philosophy behind cryptocurrencies.

So, let’s go through the reactions of fintech companies to the Russian invasion and explore how they affect the socio-economic climate in Russia and the rest of the world.

SWIFT

As pressure mounted on SWIFT to respond to the Russian invasion, the payment network obliged by suspending 7 major Russian banks from performing transactions indefinitely. The ban stops these Russian banks from accessing their global economic resources, but the country has outlined measures to combat the hard-hitting impacts of the SWIFT suspension. In anticipation of incoming economic sanctions, the Russian government developed SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) — a SWIFT equivalent that works only in Russia and some banks in Switzerland, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Cuba, and Belarus.

Russia now has to rely on China’s more formidable Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) for international transactions.

VISA

According to Statista, VISA owns 12% of all credit payment cards in the world (335 million credit cards), accounting for about 50% of the overall market shares. The company reacted to the Russian invasion by halting all its operations within Russia and banning Russian VISA cardholders from processing transactions.

According to VISA’s official statement, the company is ‘taking prompt action to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions, and is prepared to comply with additional sanctions that may be implemented’. The VISA Foundation has also donated a $2 million grant to the US Fund for UNICEF to provide the Ukrainian people with humanitarian aid.

Mastercard

Mastercard has maintained the same ironclad stance as VISA on the Russian invasion. The credit card company has reportedly forfeited about 4% of potential revenue by excluding Russians from its services.

Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach released a statement saying that the company has ceased operations in Russia, as well as banned certain Russian banks from the payment network. Miebach also affirms that the company has sent a $2 million humanitarian fund to the Red Cross, Save the Children, and employee assistance.

Amex

American Express has also joined the ranks of Visa and Mastercard in suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus. According to a memo from American Express CEO Stephen J. Squeri, the cards issued in Russian territory will no longer work in Russia or outside the country. As part of Amex’s “Do What is Right” code, the company has pledged $1 million to humanitarian organizations to provide relief to people in Ukraine affected by the war.

PayPal

PayPal has also halted all operations in Russia until further notice. Dan Schulman, PayPal CEO, released a statement saying: “PayPal supports the Ukrainian people and stands with the international community in condemning Russia’s violent military aggression in Ukraine. The tragedy taking place in Ukraine is devastating for all of us, wherever we are in the world.” He goes on to add that despite banning Russians from using PayPal’s services, the company will still provide support for Russian citizens within its workforce.

Payoneer

Payoneer’s reaction was to stop all issuance of cards to customers with postal or residential addresses within the Russian Federation. According to the company’s updated FAQs, Russian citizens with Payoneer cards issued outside Russia can still conduct transactions without restrictions.

Upwork

In an open letter to freelancers, Upwork CEO Hayden Brown reiterated the company’s mission to help improve people’s lives. As a result, with over 4% of registered freelancers from Russia and Belarus, Upwork has suspended operations and has shut down support for new business generation in both countries. To this end, the changes will take full effect on 1 May 2022, leaving freelancers and clients in Russia and Belarus unable to create new accounts, initiate new contracts, and appear in searches. The platform also donated $1 million to Direct Relief International to support Ukrainian citizens caught up in the war.

Revolut

As a company with a Ukrainian co-founder Vlad Yatsenko, Revolut has provided unwavering support for Ukrainians suffering from the war. The current CEO Nikolay Storonsky, born in Russia to a Ukrainian father, released an open letter, categorically condemning the war, saying that ‘this war is wrong and totally abhorrent’ and that ‘…not one more person should die in this needless conflict’.

In a statement titled The War on Ukraine: Our Response, Revolut has affirmed its dedication to uphold and impose sanctions placed on Russia. As part of its support to Ukraine, Revolut has removed transfer fees for every transaction going into the country. The company has also pledged to match every donation made to the Red Cross Ukraine appeal.

Stripe

Although Stripe does not work in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus, the financial services and SaaS company has pledged to impose sanctions on the Russian government and its citizens. The extent of this ban will cover transactions using the Mir payment system, as well as services linked directly or indirectly with the Crimea and the separatist Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Paysera

Paysera has released a comprehensive list of financial restrictions on Russia and its allies involved in the Ukrainian invasion:

Russian citizens will no longer be able to use Paysera (this restriction does not apply to Russian citizens with residency or work permits in other supported countries).

All current accounts belonging to Russians will be closed.

Russian and Belarusian companies are banned from using their Paysera accounts.

All current business accounts belonging to Russian and Belarusian entities will be closed.

Transactions to Russian and Belarusian banks between private individuals will continue but must go through rigorous verification procedures.

Paysera will roll back all money transfers from Russian and Belarusian banks received on Monday (23 February and later).

Paysera users can no longer exchange to Russian Roubles (RUB).

This list is only one part of the extensive regulation changes for Russian citizens and banks. For more information, read the entire press release.

Apple (Apple Pay) and Google (Google Pay)

Apple and Google set rivalries aside to impose a collective ban on the Russian government and its citizens for their actions in Ukraine. According to NPR, Apple will stop shipping products to Russia with immediate effect. This announcement sent shockwaves around the tech world because of the company’s global influence.

In the same vein, Google has also removed media platforms RT and Sputnik from its services, banning their content within EU countries.

But that’s not even half of it. Apple has furthered its crackdown on Russia by deactivating its payment service Apple Pay in the region – 29% of Russians rely on Apple Pay for contactless payments. Similar to Apple, Google Pay (used by 20% of Russians) has also ceased all digital payments by Russian citizens within occupied territories.

Money transfer services

According to Statista, the value of cross-border money transfers made by Russians in 2020 were worth over $40 billion, which is by almost $8 billion less than in 2018. In 2022, however, this sum is likely to be much lower taken the situation with the money transfer services that are leaving the Russian market.

Western Union

On 10 March 2022, Western Union issued a press release announcing that all the company’s operations in Russia and Belarus will be suspended with immediate effect. For the people of Ukraine, Western Union has created a donation portal to address the humanitarian and refugee crisis, according to Elizabeth Executive Director of the Western Union Foundation.

The money transfer company has pledged $500 000 to provide humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people. To donate to the Western Union Foundation, visit its official website.

Wise

Before the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian war, Wise (formerly TransferWise) had already placed a $200 limit for Russian account owners. With the current swathe of sanctions, the remittance and payments company has doubled down on its restriction for individuals and businesses within the Russian Federation and its (illegally) occupied territories.

Find a detailed breakdown of the restrictions according to the company’s Help Centre below:

You can only send RUB to private bank accounts or cards in Russia.

send RUB to private bank accounts or cards in Russia. You cannot send RUB to government agencies in Russia.

You cannot send RUB to Crimea or Sevastopol.

You cannot send USD or EUR to accounts in Russia.

MoneyGram

According to Quartz, MoneyGram still works both in Ukraine and Russia since the sanctioned banks — Sberbank (Russian) and VTB — are not involved in the transactions directly. This same report also shows that, on the first day of the invasion, US-based remittances to Ukraine spiked 120%, while the number rose to 50% in Russia. Nevertheless, MoneyGram has removed all fees on transfers going to Ukraine from the US, Canada, and EU.

Remitly

Remitly is a P2P service that allows immigrants to send money across borders. Since the company’s core demographics (immigrants) are closely aligned to the plight of Ukrainian refugees, it is no surprise that tit has also banned Russia. Remitly, through a spokesperson, has communicated its dedication to upholding this ban according to the EU and US sanctions.

Zepz (WorldRemit)

Zepz, formerly WorldRemit, has released a list of countries on its banned list, including Russia and Belarus. The company also released an updated list of transaction conditions, showing that Russia is on the blocklist until further notice.

“The Big Four”

Members of the Big Four — Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PwC — have also enforced the sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and EU nations. At the time of compiling this report, the aforementioned companies are not in a hurry to impose blanket sanctions on all Russian citizens since a combined 1.1% (around 13000 people) of their global workforce is in Russia.

Deloitte’s Global CEO Punit Renjen said: “Last week, Deloitte announced it was reviewing its business in Russia. We will separate our practice in Russia and Belarus from the global network of member firms. Deloitte will no longer operate in Russia and Belarus.”

Mark Walters, KPMG’s Global Head of Communications, said: “KPMG has over 4,500 people in Russia and Belarus, and ending our working relationship with them, many of whom have been a part of KPMG for many decades, is incredibly difficult.”

Mike Davies, PwC’s Director of Global Corporate Affairs and Communications, PwC UK, said: “As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine, we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network.”

EY released a statement that said: “Today, EY global organisation decided that the Russian practice will continue working with clients as an independent group of audit and consulting companies that are not part of the EY global network. The changes will take effect after the required transition period.”

The crypto world

Although the major players in FinTech are equivocal in their condemnation and boycott (full or partial) of Russia, the crypto community maintains partial neutrality. The overarching sentiment within the world of crypto is that private citizens should not suffer due to the actions of their governments. After all, some of these individuals might be using cryptocurrencies to oppose tyrannical regimes.

Notwithstanding, the Russian Central Bank has proposed a ban on mining and trading cryptocurrencies. With Russia occupying third place among Bitcoin mining regions globally, the impacts on the value and volatility of the crypto market might be extensive.

On its part, Ukraine has also used crypto assets to fund its defence against Russian aggression. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov has also posted wallet addresses for the Ukrainian Army and Civil Defense support.

Kraken

CEO of Kraken, Jesse Powell released a Twitter thread in response to the Ukrainian Prime Minister’s call on crypto exchanges to block addresses of all Russian users. In the thread, he expresses regret for the appalling conditions Ukraine finds itself in at the hands of its aggressive neighbours. However, he insists that the company cannot blanket-ban citizens ‘without a legal requirement’ to do so.

Binance

Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, released a detailed statement refuting claims that ‘Binance doesn’t apply sanctions’. He expressed that Russian individuals banned by US and EU sanction regulations are not allowed to trade on Binance.

KuCoin

KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu also refuses to freeze the accounts of Russian users, unless there is a legal precedent to do so on a case-by-case basis.In a statement to CNBC, the CEO expressed KuCoin’s stance on the issue: “As a neutral platform, we will not freeze the accounts of any users from any country without a legal requirement. And at this difficult time, actions that increase the tension to impact the rights of innocent people should not be encouraged.”

Coinbase

According to Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, the company has blocked over 25000 accounts linked with “illicit activity” with the Russian government and its allies. While the crypto exchange is dedicated to helping the Ukrainians, they refused to freeze the assets of ‘ordinary Russians’.

Nevertheless, Coinbase has implemented measures to monitor attempts by sanctioned individuals to evade the restrictions. The crypto exchange will also follow recommendations that align with government recommendations, provided they don’t interfere with individual rights.

Adyen

Although the Ayden network does not work in either Russia or Ukraine, the company has decided to offer humanitarian help to the victims of the ongoing invasion. Adyen’s policy decisions include:

Blocking sanctioned banks and private entities

Suspending US and EU processing services in Russia, Crimea, and the separatist regions in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Suspending transaction processing in Russian rubles (RUB) regardless of issuing country.

To the Ukrainian people, Adyen has pledged humanitarian support through Adyen Giving and other charities like the UNCHR Disaster Relief Fund, Giro 555, and the Red Cross.

Mintos

The loan management platform Mintos has removed loans from Russian and Ukrainian lending platforms as a ‘cautionary measure’ to protect lenders from the unprecedented repercussions of the invasion. As part of the Mintos Conservative Strategy, the company will uphold these restrictions until the conflict stabilises – or ends.

eToro

When eToro announced that it would be force-liquidating Magnit PJSC stocks (and other related Russian stocks), they probably didn’t expect such a massive amount of pushback from users who had equities in these companies. As a result of the criticism and public outcry, the company refunded all affected parties, except for leverage stakes. Despite the earlier wave of backlash, eToro is still considering what to do with nine other stocks from the country, including Sberbank of Russia, Rosneft (RNFTF), Gazprom, and Lukoil.

Conclusion

The Russo-Ukrainian war has plunged the entire financial sector into a new reality, which follows post-pandemic inflation. We are now witnessing an unprecedented situation – financial institutions and FinTech companies are reacting in real-time to impose sanctions and boycotts on Russia and its citizens. Numerous companies that aren’t obliged by law or sanctions have taken the initiative to leave the Russian market. These decisions cost each of them a significant part of revenue, yet they demonstrate the willingness to pay this price in order to help stop the war.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaWJzaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9ob3ctZmludGVjaHMtYXJlLXJlYWN0aW5nLXRvLXJ1c3NpYXMtaW52YXNpb24tb2YtdWtyYWluZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-04-26,Blue chip project Minario NFT will open a new era of actress culture ... - Digital Journal,"Minario NFT may be supported by Windvane’s “Creator Fund” and become one of the first batch of NFT blue-chip projects incubated by it.

After the release of CryptoKitties in 2017, NFT entered the public eye for the first time. Ethercat is a decentralized application released on Ethereum, where users can breed and collect various electronic cats in the game. Today, due to the continuous emergence of high-performance blockchain and layer 2 solutions, various expansion schemes have made high-throughput Dapp a reality, NFT has returned to the public eye, and the application scenarios in the Web3.0 network ecosystem are becoming more and more diverse.

The world is tolerant. The world is colorful because of cultural diversity. The actress video culture, which has always been in the “marginal” zone, has never attracted much positive attention. For many years, due to content leakage and piracy, at the same time not getting much attention and social support, the quality and value of Japanese actress video content is declining. In the view of the Minario NFT project, these contents are part of the world’s cultural diversity, copyright and quality should be protected and valued, and high-quality cultural contents should be disseminated. NFT has important application value in the confirmation of digital assets. The Minario NFT project will give play to the attributes of NFT technology, so that it can be used for actress film and television works, art creators, collectors, and the majority of actress fans in the process of protecting actress culture. Provide copyright and content quality protection to prevent the loss caused by copycat plagiarism from the root. Because everyone can check through the blockchain whether it is officially licensed, as well as its creation date, brand, series, rarity and availability.

Whether in the field of art and culture or in the blockchain industry, openness and inclusiveness are mainstream views. In order to support a more open and inclusive decentralized NFT market, KuCoin exchange launched Windvane with a value of up to $100 million on April 19. “Creator Fund”, the fund will support and incubate early NFT projects, covering culture and art, sports, PFP, Asian culture, celebrities, GameFi and other fields, in addition, the fund will invite 99 outstanding NFT creators to join Windvane (KuCoin NFT Marketplace) to accelerate the development of Web 3.0.

The specific news still needs to be officially announced.

Minario NFT uses blockchain technology to protect the video content culture of Japanese actresses, allowing actresses, film and television stars and artists to use NFT tokens to represent the ownership of their digital artworks, which can greatly improve the liquidity of artworks.

2022-04-29,Swap Farming on Binance - Intuitive Token Swaps With Up to 50% BNB Fee Rebate - CoinCodex,"Binance is the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume. At the time of writing, the platform handled $19.7 billion worth of trades on its spot markets, and a whopping $35.5 billion worth of trades on its futures markets. One of the reasons for Binance’s popularity is the large variety of cryptocurrency trading products it offers, which makes them able to cater to almost any type of cryptocurrency trader or investor.

In this article, we’ll be taking a quick look at Swap Farming, a product that provides an intuitive interface for token swaps. It also offers trading fee rebates paid in BNB, which help users cut down on trading costs. The Swap Farming product is based on Liquid Swap, which brings a DeFi-like trading experience to the Binance CEX.

Swap Tokens on Binance With BNB Fee Rebate

Swap Farming is inspired by the automated market maker (AMM) design, which is implemented in the most popular decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. In an AMM, users deposit their cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools containing two tokens. Users can tap into this liquidity and perform token swaps between the two token types included in a liquidity pool, and the liquidity providers earn a portion of the trading fee in exchange for providing liquidity.

When swapping tokens on Binance, you can forget about some of the clumsier aspects of using decentralized exchanges, like managing cryptocurrency wallets and addresses. There’s also no need to worry about smart contract bugs and exploits, which are an unfortunate side-effect of trading on decentralized protocols.

Trading on Binance via Swap Farming is very safe, but it’s not entirely risk free. You have to keep in mind that there is a risk for slippage, which is a phenomenon that occurs when a trade executes at a different price than expected. The market on Binance are highly liquid, so it’s unlikely that you will encounter significant slippage when using Swap Farming unless you are trying to trade very large amounts of cryptocurrency. The interface will also inform you about the slippage that your trade could be affected by, so you can always decline to trade if you think the slippage rate is too high.

Why use Swap Farming on Binance?

The Swap Farming feature on Binance supports more than 180 different trading pairs, so you’re likely going to find exactly the crypto assets that you’re looking for. It also offers a fee rebate, which means that you will receive back a portion of the trading fees that you pay for performing the swaps. This fee rebate is paid out in BNB.

While the DeFi can be a bit of a ""Wild West"", Binance is the most popular cryptocurrency trading platform in the world and has a strong track record on security. By using Swap Farming, you can take advantage of the popular AMM design while having the peace of mind of trading on an established cryptocurrency exchange.

Another benefit of Swap Farming is that its a simpler way of trading tokens than using standard spot trading. If you want to make a quick swap between tokens and don’t require advanced features like limit orders, Swap Farming might just be the best way to go.

Even though Swap Farming is suitable for beginners because of its simplicity, the product also caters to power users. Traders who want to access arbitrage opportunities or trade at a high frequency can use Swap Farming via the Binance Swap Farming API. If you’re interested, you can learn how to set it up here.

Binance also often holds trading competitions for high frequency traders. The exchange holds such events roughly once a month, so stay tuned on Binance’s social channels to find out when the exchange is holding any special events.

Performing a token swap via Swap Farming

You can access the product by going to the ""Trade"" section of the navigation bar and choosing ""Swap Farming"".

Then, select the token that you want to swap. In our example, this will be Chainlink (LINK), and we will be swapping to Tether (USDT). The interface will provide you with an estimate of how many tokens you will receive in return. In our example, we’ll receive around 122.4 USDT for our 10 LINK. The exact rate that the swap will execute at might change slightly compared to this estimate, but it will be roughly the same.

In the ""Summary"" section on the right, you can see the key information about the swap. This includes the current exchange rate between the two tokens you’re trying to swap, the estimated slippage, and the swap fee.

By clicking on the ""gear"" icon at the top of the interface, you can set up a custom slippage tolerance. If the swap’s expected slippage is higher than the selected slippage tolerance, the swap will not be executed. You can choose between the three pre-defined values or set a custom percentage.

You can quickly spot if the pair you chose is eligible for rewards by looking for the ""Rewards available"" icon.

The swap we chose is eligible for a swap fee rebate, which will be paid out in the form of BNB. We will be receiving 45% of the fee we pay back in BNB, which means that we will effectively only be paying a 0.11% fee on the transaction (the nominal swap fee is 0.2%). The fee rebate varies between different trading pairs on Swap Farming, and is typically between 35% and 50%.

You can see the rewards that you’ve accumulated so far in the ""Swap Rewards"" section. After clicking ""Claim"", your rewards will be transferred to your spot wallet.

If you want to check the history of your swaps, you can click on the ""clock"" icon at the top of the interface.

The bottom line

With the Swap Farming product, Binance is offering the best of both worlds – the ease of token swaps popularized by DeFi and the robust liquidity and security offered by high quality centralized exchanges. The liquidity on Binance is strong enough that slippage, which can have a significant impact on less liquid DEXes, most likely won’t represent a problem. The BNB trading fee rebates are also sweeten the deal, as they effectively reduce the amount of fees paid by users by almost 50%.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NDIzL3N3YXAtZmFybWluZy1vbi1iaW5hbmNlLWludHVpdGl2ZS10b2tlbi1zd2Fwcy13aXRoLXVwLXRvLTUwLWJuYi1mZWUtcmViYXRlL9IBcmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NDIzL3N3YXAtZmFybWluZy1vbi1iaW5hbmNlLWludHVpdGl2ZS10b2tlbi1zd2Fwcy13aXRoLXVwLXRvLTUwLWJuYi1mZWUtcmViYXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-04-29,DeFi Trading Engine Polkadex Vies For Parachain Slot in New Polkadot Auction - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

The 16th Polkadot parachain auction starts today, with multiple blockchain projects competing to secure their own parachain

Thanks to strong community support and high-profile partnership, Polkadex (PDEX) is one of the favorites to come out on top in the latest auction

Polkadex is a decentralized P2P orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for Web3 and DeFi

Strong community support is helping Polkadex secure its own Polkadot parachain

A new round of Polkadot parachain auctions started today, with several blockchain projects competing to secure their own parachain slot. Polkadex (PDEX) enters the 16th auction with over 300,000 DOT committed from previous auctions and is closely trailing Bifrost Finance, which is currently in first.

Polkadex is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange designed to facilitate Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) trading. The Polkadex team has built the platform using Substrate and aims to combine the best of centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) into a single platform using the orderbook-based approach.

At the time of this writing, 311,250 DOT across 1270 contributions have been invested in the Polkadex Crowdloan. The high level of community support for the project can be attributed to Polkadex’s partnership with a number of high-profile cryptocurrency players, including Parallel Finance, Equilibrium, KuCoin, Kraken, and Gate.io. It is worth noting that by far the largest share of contribution, approximately 47%, has been made using Parallel Finance, a parachain slot winner from the first batch of Polkadot auctions.

The First Batch of Parachains Goes Live on Polkadot as the Platform Completes Its Launch

Polkadex CEO and co-founder Gautham J commented on the importance of securing a parachain slot:

“Securing a parachain slot will go a long way towards fulfilling Polkadex’s mission of becoming the trading engine of the whole DeFi and Web 3.”

Polkadex winning the auction and securing its own parachain would go a long way toward boosting the liquidity of the broader DeFi ecosystem. Thanks to the innovative Polkadex Orderbook and other trading products, native tokens on the Polkadot ecosystem, including those of live and soon to be live parachain projects, will be available on the cross-chain, non-custodial Polkadex exchange.

Polkadex COO and Co-Founder Deepansh Singh expressed his gratitude to the community for the support for Polkadex and the Polkadex Crowdloans in a statement. “We could not be more excited for Polkadex to support liquidity and assets from across the Polkadot ecosystem and its other parachains,” remarked Singh and added that winning a parachain slot will enable this to “happen smoothly”.

Widespread support for Polkadex can in large part be credited to a lucrative parachain reward program put together by the Polkadex team. Since the team has allocated 2 million PDEX tokens to the rewards pool and there is a 1 million DOT auction cap, each Polkadex Crowdloan contributor will earn at least 2 PDEX for each DOT invested. The new rewards structure is more than 10 times as lucrative for users than the one offered during the second batch of Polkadot auctions that started in December. In addition to PDEX-based rewards, the team will also distribute special NFTs to the top 1,000 DOT contributors that will provide exclusive discounts and trading privileges when using the Polkadex Orderbook.

Since the first batch of parachain auctions went live last November, more than 147 million DOT (worth approx. $2.44 billion at the current market rates) have been raised in crowdloan campaigns of various blockchain projects competing for their own parachain slot. Parachains are customized blockchains designed to feed into the Polkadot Relay Chain. The project-specific design lets them attain higher throughput while maintaining low transaction costs. Each auction winner earns a Polkadot parachain lease for a period of 96 weeks.

The 16th parachain auction starts today (April 29) and will last until May 6.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NDAyL2RlZmktdHJhZGluZy1lbmdpbmUtcG9sa2FkZXgtdmllcy1mb3ItcGFyYWNoYWluLXNsb3QtaW4tbmV3LXBvbGthZG90LWF1Y3Rpb24v0gF0aHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTQ0MDIvZGVmaS10cmFkaW5nLWVuZ2luZS1wb2xrYWRleC12aWVzLWZvci1wYXJhY2hhaW4tc2xvdC1pbi1uZXctcG9sa2Fkb3QtYXVjdGlvbi8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2023-09-23,"Currency devaluation, other fueling adoption of digital currency in ... - Blueprint Newspapers Limited","



An industry report by cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin has revealed that more Africans are being pushed into the cryptocurrency market because of the rising inflation and devaluation of local currencies.

According to the report, this is so because many are avoiding losing the value of their savings following the consistent devaluation of currencies and the rising inflation rate plaguing most countries on the planet.

In Nigeria, the Central Bank has devalued the naira three times in the last two years, while inflation is down from 16.47 percent in January 2021 to 15.7 percent as of February 2022 – but the figure is said not to reflect market realities.

The naira is becoming weaker in response to the aforementioned, and with some African countries sharing similar fate, Nigerians and citizens of the continent are turning to bitcoin and other crypto assets to maintain their purchasing power.

This fueled the number of cryptocurrency users in Africa by 2,467.2 percent year-on-year, according to the KuCoin report for last year, and this drove growth of crypto transactions by over 2,500 percent in 2021, while monthly transactions grew 1,386.7 percent.

Explaining the impact of inflation and devaluation in the adoption of the digital currency, KuCoin wrote, “the adoption of crypto technologies in Africa was preceded by the availability of the technology and the presence of several motivating factors.

“These include the desire of

the population to react quickly to any changes in the exchange rate of national currencies in countries with high rates of inflation and devaluation,” the report reads.

The cryptocurrency exchange further stated that, “The possibility of quickly transferring investments across assets mitigates the chance of savings depreciation.”, although the report acknowledged that not all countries are as inflationary.

However, it said, “the desire to preserve the purchasing power, even under 6.4 percent inflation (Tunisia), is natural for those seeking to preserve the value of their savings.”

Aside from trying to mitigate inflation and devaluation in the continent, Africans also embraced cryptocurrency to evade high cross-border transfer fee, with many crypto cross-border transactions hovering around 0.01 percent.

The low transaction fee serves as an incentive, hence cross-border transfers accounting for 88.5 percent of cryptocurrency transactions in Africa, “In many cases, users pay less than 0.01 percent of the overall amount of the transaction transferred in cryptocurrencies.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYmx1ZXByaW50Lm5nL2N1cnJlbmN5LWRldmFsdWF0aW9uLW90aGVyLWZ1ZWxpbmctYWRvcHRpb24tb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1jdXJyZW5jeS1pbi1hZnJpY2EtcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-19,"Four years on, Telegram’s former blockchain project gains ground in Africa - Cointelegraph","It was 2018 when privacy-focused messaging platform Telegram announced that it was in the process of building a blockchain-based decentralized computer network technology called the Telegram Open Network.

However, following a lengthy litigation battle that lasted until May 2020 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over its $1.7 billion initial coin offering (ICO), Telegram had to sever its ties with the project, leading many to believe that it was done for.

That said, far from everyone’s expectations, the project — now renamed The Open Network (TON) —seems to have found a new lease on life and is thriving. For starters, the TON Foundation recently revealed that it was choosing TONcoin.fund as its official ecosystem fund, securing an initial collective commitment of approximately $250 million from major firms within the industry including Huobi Incubator, KuCoin Ventures, MEXC Pioneer Fund, 3Commas Capital, blockchain startup Orbs and TON Miners.

As part of the development, reports suggest that TONcoin.fund will be working closely with the TON Foundation to deploy the aforementioned sum of money to explore a wide array of opportunities within the nonfungible token (NFT), Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces, as well as for the incubation and development of various novel programs, grants, hackathons and more. On the subject, TONcoin.fund managing partner Benjamin Rameau said:

“TON may become the first blockchain network accessible to millions of users thanks to the Telegram integration efforts by the community via in-app bots [...] TON will not just be the blockchain that people use on Telegram — it will define people’s online identity and will act as a bridge between all their Web3 and Web2 activities.”

Developments surrounding TON

Even after shutting down its involvement with TON a couple of years back, Telegram founder Pavel Durov has publicly expressed his support for the project, especially during Q4 2021 when Telegram revealed that it was integrating TON’s payment solution into its existing user interface.

It also bears mentioning that the Toncoin fundraiser comes on the same day that a number of African nations — namely Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Republic of the Congo — disclosed their plans to adopt TON’s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain for driving their future economic progress. To this point, reports suggest that the DRC is even considering releasing a multipurpose national stablecoin using the TON blockchain.

To get a better idea of the situation, Cointelegraph reached out to the TON Foundation, with a representative for the organization pointing out that the company is currently in “advanced level talks” with several governments across Africa, plus the three countries listed above. He added:

“The goal of these collaborations is to facilitate their adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain based solutions on the TON blockchain. This is a central component of their plans to drive future economic progress.”

The representative further stated that the minister for digital economy of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Désiré Cashmir Eberande Kolongele, is looking to commence the launch of a national stablecoin on the TON blockchain, democratizing access to the nation’s financial system where millions of citizens still remain under and unbanked. In this regard, Kolongele was quoted saying:

“The ability to integrate applications with the Telegram platform and reach mobile users makes TON the obvious choice as we step boldly into the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.”

TON’s long-term intention with these moves is to potentially integrate with Telegram, thereby allowing users across Africa to facilitate payments with the touch of a button, all while providing people living across these regions to tap into the burgeoning DeFi system.

Recent: Is asymmetric information driving crypto’s wild price swings?

The last couple of months have continued to see the TON network achieve new all-time highs as well as meet many of its envisioned milestones that had been laid out in its roadmap. For example, a spokesperson for TON told Cointelegraph that the total number of wallet addresses on the TON blockchain have more than doubled since the start of the year, recently surpassing the 400,000 mark.

Last month, the project finalized its token standard known as “Jetton,” resulting in more and more investors — both retail as well as institutional — gravitating toward the project. To this point, Bit.com, a crypto exchange helmed by fintech firm Matrixport that has $10 billion in assets under management, announced a strategic partnership with TON to develop, enhance and expand the project’s existing infrastructure.

The future looks bright

In recent years, a growing list of prominent cryptocurrency projects has continued to make inroads into Africa. For example, Cardano has been quite active within the region over the last couple of years, with company founder Charles Hoskinson stating in a recent interview that he sees more than 100 million users from the continent entering the DeFi sector within the next three years.

Similarly, projects like Ethereum, Stellar and Celo are also vying to mold Africa’s rapidly evolving Web3 economy. For example, the Ethereum Foundation recently committed significant financial resources toward an insurance program relating to 6 million Kenyan farmers.

The Stellar Development Foundation has announced multiple initiatives including a partnership with African unicorn Flutterwave to launch new Europe-Africa remittance corridors, an investment in a Nigerian remittance platform, as well as a $30 million matching fund, which has invested in Afriex, a remittance app that allows users to send/receive funds from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Canada and the United States.

Recent: How Web3 is redefining storytelling for creators and fans through NFTs

Within this context, TON’s continued forging of long-term, strategic partnerships with prominent African nations stand to transform into a widely used blockchain project. In fact, Minette Libom Li Likeng, minister of posts and telecommunications for Cameroon — one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa — believes that TON can revolutionize his country’s payment landscape radically while promoting financial inclusivity at levels that have yet to be witnessed in the region before.

Similarly, Congolese Minister for posts, telecommunications and the digital economy Léon Juste Ibombo is of the view that TON can serve as an “invaluable, practical instrument for the growth and creation of wealth” within his country, both at the government as well as grass-root level. Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how TONs use cases continue to evolve and whether or not the project is able to position itself as a market leader within the global blockchain ecosystem.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3VyLXllYXJzLW9uLXRlbGVncmFtLXMtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1wcm9qZWN0LWdhaW5zLWdyb3VuZC1pbi1hZnJpY2HSAWVodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvZm91ci15ZWFycy1vbi10ZWxlZ3JhbS1zLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tcHJvamVjdC1nYWlucy1ncm91bmQtaW4tYWZyaWNhL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-18,"Despite CBN ban, 33.4 million Nigerians trade crypto – Report - Punch Newspapers","Despite the Central Bank of Nigeria’s restriction on cryptocurrencies-related transactions in the banking sector, a report by a crypto platform has said about 33.4 million Nigerians trade or own crypto assets.

In its report, ‘Into The Cryptoverse: Decoding The World Of Crypto Consumers,’ KuCoin, a crypto exchange with over 10 million registered users, said the crypto population is largely dominated by 18 to 60-year-olds.

It said, “According to Google Trends, Nigeria was recorded as the country with the highest number of bitcoin searches globally in early 2021, signaling the growing utility of cryptocurrency in the country.

“The data also pointed out that the country’s youth have been the decisive force behind the surge in bitcoin searches. According to our survey conducted in early 2022, 33.4 million Nigerians, which accounts for 35 per cent of the population aged 18 to 60, currently own or have traded cryptocurrencies over the past six months.

“70 per cent of these crypto investors claim that they will likely increase their cryptocurrency assets soon. Another six per cent of the country’s population are interested in investing in cryptocurrency in the coming 6 months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency adoption rate might continue to increase.”

According to the crypto exchange, the depreciation of the naira over the last six years has fuelled the increase in the number of crypto users in the nation.

It added, “The Nigerian currency, Naira, has depreciated by more than 209 per cent in the past six years. Some Nigerians recognised the financial opportunity brought by Bitcoin early on.

“According to our survey, 37 per cent of crypto investors in the country began trading cryptocurrencies more than three years ago. At the same time, 6 per cent started trading cryptocurrencies more than six years ago.

“Meanwhile, as prices continue to rise, with food inflation reaching its highest point since 2008, the challenging economic climate in Nigeria remains and has even worsened by COVID-19, making cryptocurrencies attractive alternative sources of income, particularly in the bullish market in 2021. According to the survey, 26 per cent of crypto investors have begun trading cryptocurrencies in the last 6 months.”

The firm said the average number of monthly transactions across African countries showed a 1,386.7 per cent from January 2021 to January 2022.

It added the number of users also increased by 2,467.2 per cent within the same time period.

According to a report by Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria and other African countries grew by 1200 per cent in 2021.

The firm added that Nigeria is the sixth leading country in the world in terms of cryptocurrency adoption as a result of its peer-to-peer monetary systems.

The report said the African region, dominated by Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania, has one of the highest grassroots adoptions of crypto in the world. It added that Africa has the third-fastest growing cryptocurrency economy in the world.

The International Monetary Fund recently said the adoption of crypto assets was being driven by emerging markets and developing economies. It added that countries in this region increased their trading volumes in crypto exchanges in 2021.

In February of 2021, the CBN put a restriction on cryptocurrency transactions in the nation. It had said, “Further to earlier regulatory directives on the subject, the bank hereby wishes to remind regulated institutions that dealing with cryptocurrencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited.”

Recently, the CBN fined three Deposit Money Banks N800m fine for violating its regulations barring customers from transacting in cryptocurrencies.

Project Galaxy (GAL) is the next project to be featured on Binance Launchpool

Project Galaxy is creating a network for Web3 credentials

Users will be able to earn GAL by staking BNB, BUSD and CAKE

Project Galaxy (GAL) is coming to Binance Launchpool

Popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance has revealed that Project Galaxy (GAL) is the next project to be featured on their Launchpool platform. Starting on May 5, Binance will also list GAL in the exchange’s “innovation zone” in trading pairs against BTC, BNB, BUSD and USDT.

Create Binance Account

Project Galaxy is a building a network for Web3 credentials. These credentials help users prove various facts about their history on the blockchain, for example their interactions with money market protocols, or contributions to on-chain governance. Users can effectively create a digital identity that consists of information sourced from multiple blockchains. Projects can leverage this data in rewarding positive contributors, assigning “credit scores”, whitelisting, etc. Project Galaxy’s GAL tokens are used for governing the protocol, paying fees and curating credentials.

On Binance Launchpool, users will be able to earn GAL tokens by staking BNB, BUSD, or CAKE. Launchpool programs represent a way for users to get their hands on some new tokens with practically no risk, especially if they’re already holding the tokens they intend to stake. Staked funds can be unstaked at any time with no penalties, and any staked BNB still counts towards the exchange’s standard BNB holding benefits. Rewards are calculated on an hourly basis, at can be claimed at any time.

How to earn Project Galaxy (GAL) tokens on Binance Launchpool?

In total, 3 million GAL tokens will be distributed to stakers on Binance Launchpool. This represents 1.5% of the token’s total supply (200 million tokens). Of the 3 million tokens that will be distributed, 70% will be going to BNB stakers. 20% will be distributed to CAKE stakers, and the remaining 10% will be going to BUSD. The amount of tokens each user receives depends on the duration of their stake, as well as the size of their stake relative to the size of the staking pool they’re using.

Users will be able to earn GAL rewards on Binance Launchpool from April 29 at 00:00 AM (UTC) to May 28 at 11:59 PM (UTC).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0Mzc5L2JpbmFuY2UtbGF1bmNocG9vbC13aWxsLWZlYXR1cmUtcHJvamVjdC1nYWxheHktZ2FsLXJld2FyZHMtZm9yLWJuYi1idXNkLWFuZC1jYWtlLXN0YWtlcnMv0gGAAWh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0Mzc5L2JpbmFuY2UtbGF1bmNocG9vbC13aWxsLWZlYXR1cmUtcHJvamVjdC1nYWxheHktZ2FsLXJld2FyZHMtZm9yLWJuYi1idXNkLWFuZC1jYWtlLXN0YWtlcnMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-03-02,"Bee Crypto: A Scam or A revolution in Mining - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News","Cryptocurrencies have often been associated with nerds all this while as per the general perception. For example, when you speak of mining Bitcoin or Ether, all those technical jargons like ASICS and GPU units fly thick and fast around your head. For a common individual who would like to explore the infinite sea of possibilities that cryptocurrencies offer, they need to first understand ASICS and GPUs to mine BTC and ETH.

That’s too much technicality for common folks, right. What if there’s a much simpler alternative available which allows you to mine crypto with no fuss. That’s what the Bee Network promises to the crypto fraternity. Without any further ado, let’s deep dive and understand the Bee network so that you can easily mine or invest in this token with ease.

What is the Bee Network?

Bee Network heralds a new concept in blockchain where mining shouldn’t be taken as a capital-intensive technique. The purpose of the Bee ecosystem is to welcome as many miners on its network as possible through a simplified mining process. Unlike mining BTC and ETH, to mine Bee token all you need is just a phone.

Install the Bee application which lets you log into the mining pool. Once you are done with that, the mining process will be set on an auto-run mode for 24*&7 and 365 days. It is more or less like a daily chore. The cost-effective nature of the mining has so far brought as high as 8 million miners to its mining pools.

How To Mine Bee Crypto On Phone?

Step 1

To mine the Bee crypto, you need to first download the application from the official application store. If you are using Apple devices, visit the App store; whereas, if you have an Android phone, you can go to the Google Play Store.

Step 2

Connect the app you have just downloaded with a phone number for further processes. You do have the option to even open via the Facebook account.

Step 3

There’s SMS verification as well and a code will be sent on the registered mobile number. Input the code in the code section to initiate the process.

Step 4

If you have a referral code, you can enter that and proceed with benefits.

Step 5

Once all the above processes are complete, you can now see the balance, team member and mining rates as shown in the image below.

Is Bee Network a Scam?

Technically speaking, Bee Network completely mirrors the Pi Network; however, there’s just one difference, it is completely anonymous. For the Pi Network, you can very well see their team members who are pretty active on LinkedIn. Whereas, when it comes to Bee Network, there’s just abstract information available on the public domain where they claim that the team comprises top-tier experts with hands-on experience on Internet, blockchain technology, and cryptography.

That perhaps is too abstract to believe in any project. On top of this, it has been alleged that Bee Network has been secretly stealing users’ data. On some of the phones, especially, the Android version, it is necessary to allow access to locations, contacts, calls, and applications. All of these aspects take the ecosystem far away from the ethos of decentralization and blockchain.

How Much Will Be Bee Crypto Worth? Price Prediction and Analysis

Bee Network Token like other cryptos has witnessed a period of parabolic explosion followed by nose-diving price action. Having said that, here’s what the charts suggest for the Bee Token;

7-day price action shows a further downward trend taking the prices below the 0.001 support level.

Germany had ranked fourth on Coincub’s list last year.

The report ranked 46 countries based on a range of factors, including newly added categories such as the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in each country, fraud case prevalence and the availability of crypto courses by leading institutions.



The three-place jump in Germany’s rank comes after crypto exchange KuCoin had published a report last month showing that 16% of the German population between ages 18 and 60 own crypto or have traded it in the past six months.

41% of those investors intend to increase their allocations to the crypto space in the coming six months.

German magazine Capital first reported in December 2021 that the country’s savings banks, which hold more than 1 trillion euros, were looking to offer a wallet to trade cryptocurrency. The Coincub report had called the decision a “groundbreaking” development that signals higher institutional acceptance of crypto, as per Blockworks.

German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse has also listed more than 20 crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) on its digital exchange, Xetra, over the past few months.

Singapore, which previously ranked number one on the list, dropped to second due to government decisions to restrict crypto services advertising and a clampdown on bitcoin ATMs, according to Coincub.

The United States ranked third among crypto-friendly countries due in part to its decision to seek clearer crypto regulation, the report noted.

The United Arab Emirates, which ranked 22, was a new addition to the list following its recent plans to become one of the world’s crypto hotspots.

Crypto banning nation China remained at the list’s bottom following its widespread ban on trading and mining crypto.

The exchange is known to crypto enthusiasts for its large selection of listed cryptocurrencies, which ranges from the top crypto assets to small-cap altcoins. Huobi handles billions of dollars worth of trade volume across its spot and derivatives markets, and supports advanced features like cryptocurrency staking, Polkadot parachain auctions, token sales and Primepool promotions.

Create Huobi Account

Step-by-step guide

Sending USDT from your Bybit account to Huobi is not a complex process, but we'll show you a step-by-step guide to clear up any questions you might have.

1. Find your USDT deposit address on Huobi

We'll start by finding our USDT deposit address on Huobi. Log in to your Huobi account and choose ""Balances"".

Now, you can search USDT or click on deposit. The deposit button is on the right side.

Make sure that you have selected USDT. Since USDT is available on multiple blockchains, select the specific blockchain that you want to be receiving the USDT on. Once you have selected the blockchain platform, you can copy the address or scan the QR code.

2. Withdraw USDT from Bybit to your Huobi deposit address

Enter your Bybit account and go to ""Assets"". If there are assets on the derivatives account, transfer them to the spot account. First, you have to connect your withdrawal address (the address that you copied on Huobi) to your Bybit account. If you are trading in a web browser, click Add and set the address. Make sure that the ""Chain Type"" matches the blockchain you selected for your Huobi deposit address. For example, if you selected ERC-20 to get your Huobi deposit address, you must also select ERC-20 when transfering USDT from your Bybit account.

Enter the address that you copied from Huobi. Set the number of coins that you want to withdraw and click ""Submit"".

After clicking ""Submit"", you will need to authorize the withdrawal through a verification code from Google Authenticator.

You will also receive a verification code via the email address associated with your Bybit account.

3. Check your USDT deposit on Huobi

When your USDT deposit is finished, the current status will be shown on “Recent deposit records”.

Why would you want to send coins between different exchanges?

Users transfer coins from one crypto exchange to others for many different motives and objectives:

Some coins aren't available on certain exchanges

Users may want to leverage opportunities connected to arbitrage, lending, etc.

Some crypto exchanges don't support deposit or withdrawal in fiat currency

Is transferring USDT from Bybit to Huobi safe?

This transfer is safe on the condition that you choose the correct chain and submit the correct address. The preferred chain should be available on both exchanges. For example, when you choose TRC-20 on Bybit, you have to select the same chain on Huobi as well. Also, make sure that you are using the legitimate Bybit and Huobi websites, as cryptocurrency exchanges are often impersonated by phishing scams.

If you are transferring a substantial amount of funds, we recommend that you start out with a small test transaction to check that everything is working correctly.

Closing thoughts

Transferring crypto assets from Bybit to Huobi is a simple task, and you just have to pay attention to some subtle points. The transferred asset and the preferred chain must be supported by both exchanges. Be careful when you are copying the addresses. If you do it wrong or select the improper chain, you will not be able to access the coins anymore.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzOTY3L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20tYnliaXQtdG8taHVvYmkv0gFQaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTM5NjcvaG93LXRvLXRyYW5zZmVyLXVzZHQtZnJvbS1ieWJpdC10by1odW9iaS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-14,"35% of Nigerian adults are crypto investors, according to a new report - Business Insider Africa","According to the report titled: Into The Cryptoverse, 33.4 million Nigerians, which accounts for 35% of the population aged 18 to 60, currently own cryptocurrencies or have traded cryptocurrencies over the past 6 months.

The report also noted that 52% of Nigerian crypto investors allocate over half of their assets to cryptocurrencies. At the same time, 65% of Nigerian crypto investors make fiat deposits to cryptocurrencies via peer-to-peer trading.

Another important finding is that 70% of Nigerian crypto investors intend to increase their cryptocurrency investments over the next 6 months, giving reasons to believe that digital asset adoption in the country is accelerating.

The report noted that such rates of adoption could be attributed to the fact that the Nigerian currency, Naira, has depreciated by over 209% in the past six years.

“With national inflation rates climbing to their highest point since 2008, the challenging economic climate in Nigeria was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, making cryptocurrencies an attractive alternative source of income, particularly in the bullish market in 2021,” the report noted.

Further insights from the report showed that Nigerian crypto investors allocate an average of 60% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, followed by cash/bank deposits (20%) and foreign currencies (7%), and other instruments. 52% of Nigerian crypto investors allocate over half of their investments to cryptocurrencies, while so-called “super crypto investors”, which account for 22% of total crypto investors in the country, allocate over 90% of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency adoption rate increases in Nigeria are also evident from the previous report, according to KuCoin data, which identified that the average number of monthly transactions across African countries has shown a 1,386.7% increase from January 2021 to January 2022, with the number of users also indicating a 2,467.2% spike over the same period.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbG9jYWwvbWFya2V0cy8zNS1vZi1uaWdlcmlhbi1hZHVsdHMtYXJlLWNyeXB0by1pbnZlc3RvcnMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWEtbmV3LXJlcG9ydC81NmxocjY20gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbG9jYWwvbWFya2V0cy8zNS1vZi1uaWdlcmlhbi1hZHVsdHMtYXJlLWNyeXB0by1pbnZlc3RvcnMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWEtbmV3LXJlcG9ydC81NmxocjY2LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-03-05,What is Immutable X? - Cryptosrus,"GameStop chose Ethereum scaling solution Immutable X for its NFT marketplace. Find out why in our “What is Immutable X?” guide.

COVERED:

What is Immutable X?

Who Created Immutable X?

How it Works?

What is IMX?

Concerns

WHAT IS IMMUTABLE X?

Immutable X is an Ethereum-based blockchain platform, which has been specifically designed for NFT-based projects and token-driven video games. It is a layer 2 (L2) scaling protocol for NFTs on Ethereum. It enables transactions at lightning-fast speeds, with low computing power and a lower environmental impact. It enables instant trading and zero gas fees for trading and minting, in addition to added security features inherited from Ethereum. It takes hundreds of thousands of transactions on its own blockchain and then commits them to Ethereum through rollup.

Videogame retailing giant GameStop along with its huge marketplace as a platform for buying and selling in-game assets has partnered with Immutable X for its non-fungible token(NFT) marketplace. Both these companies have also established a fund worth $100 million that is focused on NFT gaming to support creators of NFT content. This fund is in the form of Immutable’s IMX tokens that will support the developers who are willing to launch their gaming NFT projects on the marketplace.

WHO CREATED IT?

Immutable X was created by an Australia-based company called Immutable. Robbie Ferguson is the co-founder and current CEO of Immutable. The purpose behind Immutable X is to tap into the massive potential of blockchain-based gaming, and NFTs, by offering a unique L2 solution to the problems faced by the Ethereum network. Gods Unchained, which is a popular trading card game, is the first game to utilize Immutable X to launch on Ethereum.

Robbie Ferguson explains the vision behind Immutable X, and its partnership with Gamestop by saying “Until now, developers have been challenged to create in-game items that players can truly own due to prohibitive (Ethereum) gas fees. By building on Immutable X, GameStop is seeking to tap into Ethereum’s dominant and open ecosystem of NFTs, creating massive opportunities for participation and liquidity. This is a huge leap forward for the gaming industry and blockchain”

HOW IT WORKS

Immutable X is a blockchain specifically built to accommodate the transaction of NFTs on Ethereum. It promises faster transactions with zero fees. It achieves its purpose by utilizing StarkWare’s zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-Rollups). It uses zero-knowledge proofs to conduct transactions on GameStop’s NFT marketplace. Basically what this allows is for third parties to validate transactions without them knowing every single bit of the data. It is the main reason behind the network’s increased scalability and decreased gas fees without compromising user custody.

The project employs the use of ZK-Rollups, L2 Scaling. This means that a large number of transactions are batched together into one single transaction. Each individual transaction can then individually be verified by smart contracts. However, as the name indicates, ‘zero knowledge’ of the complete transaction data is required in order for the transaction to be validated. This greatly reduces the computational power and storage required to validate blocks, thus massively enhancing scalability. Immutable X allows more than 9,000 NFT trades, mints, and transfers per second.

Immutable is also the developer of the digital card game “Gods Unchained” and “Guild of Guardians” which are NFT-based games and use the “play-to-earn” model. NFTs represent in-game items. An NFT behaves like ownership for a particular digital item. This allows the player to trade their items outside an approved marketplace, as they have the real ownership of their in-game items. A popular example of this concept is the Ethereum-based game, “Axie Infinity.” It has monsters and land plots as tradable NFTs. The in-game economy is run by NFTs and cryptocurrency that can be converted into real money for the players.

Similarly, Gods Unchained incorporates Immutable X in its operation as the players can buy and sell their digital goods. Immutable X has its own marketplace known as the Immutable X exchange. Furthermore, the NFTs created by the players can be sold on other marketplaces as well.

WHAT IS IMX TOKEN?

IMX is the native token of the Immutable X protocol. Users can stake, vote, and pay transaction fees via IMX tokens. 20% of the protocol fee must be paid in IMX tokens. Likewise, the tokens that are received as a part of the fee capture mechanism are sent to the staking reward pool, thereby rewarding the qualified stakers proportionally.

The users who hold IMX tokens also have the right to vote on token-related proposals through decentralized governance. These proposals may include certain topics like how to allocate token reserves, voting on developer grants, daily reward activation, or changes in token supply. However it should be noted that Immutable X is not a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) yet, and the final decisions about the future development of the project remain with the team.

At the time of writing, IMX has a circulating supply of more than 225,684,001 tokens. The maximum and total token supply is 2,000,000,000 IMX tokens, which makes it a deflationary currency.

Concerns

Immutable X’s utility and purpose lie within the field of NFTs. NFTs have seen a huge boom in 2021, and the future role of NFTs in many different fields is undoubtable. That also means that there is huge competition in this space. Companies like Enjin, are already well-established in the NFT space. It remains to be seen whether or not Immutable X will be able to carve out a place for itself in the NFT space.

The other important function of Immutable X is to provide a scaling solution for Ethereum. Although it may seem to be a useful, and purposeful solution to the problems faced by the users on Ethereum, the only question is, till when? Ethereum is working on its upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, and if the update successfully solves the problems faced by the network, then scaling solutions like Immutable X, and Polygon may be out of business.

Where To Buy IMX?

You can purchase IMX through KuCoin exchange, similar to how you would buy another cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you are willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current price and have your order filled almost immediately. If you are interested in purchasing IMX, you can do so by visiting KuCoin.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1pbW11dGFibGUteC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-15,Charles Hoskinson Tweets Offer At Elon Musk - Cryptosrus,"Charles Hoskinson shoots his shot again. This time at Mr. Free Speech Elon Musk.

Covered:

Elon Musk Tries To Buy Twitter

Charles Hoskinson Wants In On Free Speech

Elon Musk Tries To Buy Twitter

Elon Musk, as some of you may have heard, is on a quest to save free speech. Originally, Musk had expressed interest in starting his own freewheeling app to compete with Twitter in the marketplace of ideas but has since pivoted to trying to outright buy the platform.

After buying into the company with an aggressive share purchase — making him the largest shareholder of the social media giant — he went on to outright make a 43 billion dollar offer.

Though, apparently, his money is no good at the company that Jack Dorsey left in the fall. One of the reasons, according to the LA Times, is the offer appears to be another one of Musk’s cypher memes — the price per share offer is $420. Another is the company believes its worth at least 60 billion.

Regardless, it looks like Twitter, as of now, doesn’t appear to be in the Bond villain’s Musk’s grasp. So the dreams of Elon Musk “freeing” Twitter from its shackles and making it a utopian social media platform where free speech rules and dogecoins are the reserve currency appear to be fading.

However, Musk might have some options in the crypto world.

Charles Hoskinson Wants In On Free Speech

Charles Hoskinson, as he often does, decided to interject himself. “Elon if Twitter rejects your offer, then hit me up. Happy to build a decentralized one,” Hoskinson tweeted at Musk. Musk has yet to respond.

Hoskinson’s Twitter shots don’t always get responses, like that time he tweeted at Reese Witherspoon. But when he does get a response, it doesn’t go well, like that time with Mark Cuban.

Suffice it to say, Musk is likely to still have his sights still set on Twitter and isn’t going to take Hoskinson up on his generous offer. Not to mention, Hoskinson, in the past, has been vociferous critic of Musk’s beloved Dogecoin. Considering Musk’s trolling tendencies, any potential social media platform where Dogecoin isn’t the reserve currency is likely a non-starter.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vY2hhcmxlcy1ob3NraW5zb24tdHdlZXRzLW9mZmVyLWF0LWVsb24tbXVzay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-18,MetaMask Issues Warning About Phishing Attacks Via iCloud After a ... - Cryptonews,"MetaMask Issues Warning About Phishing Attacks Via iCloud After a User Lost USD 650K

Source: AdobeStock / bilalulker

Popular software crypto wallet MetaMask has issued a warning about possible phishing attacks through Apple’s cloud service iCloud. The warning comes after scammers managed to steal USD 650,000 worth of crypto using this attack vector.

The company detailed that MetaMask vaults, the encrypted passwords also known as seed phrases, are uploaded to iCloud if the backup option is enabled. This would enable scammers to gain access to the seed phrase as soon as they compromise a user’s iCloud account.

""If you have enabled iCloud backup for app data, this will include your password-encrypted MetaMask vault,"" MetaMask said. ""If your password isn’t strong enough, and someone phishes your iCloud credentials, this can mean stolen funds.""

MetaMask also provided users with a guide on how to disable iCloud backups for MetaMask.

The warning comes after scammers used this attack vector to drain funds from a user's MetaMask wallet. Called Domenic Iacovone on Twitter, the user says he received a call from ""Apple.""

The user got multiple text messages asking him to reset his Apple ID password on April 15, according to Serpent, founder of Sentinel, a discord and crypto threat mitigation system.

The messages came from a spoofed caller ID trying to impersonate ""Apple Inc."" They said there was suspicious activity on the victim's Apple ID and asked for a one-time verification code to prove the owner of the Apple ID account.

""After giving the 6 digit verification code, the scammers hung up and his MetaMask wallet was wiped, with over [USD] 650,000 stolen,"" Serpent said, adding that this was possible because the user's seed phrase was saved on their iCloud.

3/ MetaMask actually saves your seed phrase file on your iCloud. The scammers requested a password reset for the victim's Apple ID. After receiving the 2FA code, they were able to take control over the Apple ID, and access iCloud which gave them access to the victim's MetaMask. — Serpent (@Serpent) April 17, 2022

In total, the user lost ETH 132.86 (USD 387,500) and USDT 252,400, currently worth some USD 639,900. Notably, the stolen funds were worth north of USD 655,000 on the day of the incident when ETH was trading much higher.

Meanwhile, in a recent Twitter thread, Taylor Monahan, founder and CEO at MyCrypto, an Ethereum wallet manager, noted the countless ways that a MetaMask wallet user can lose their secret recovery phrase and ""get rekt.""

She detailed that sharing the secret recovery phrase on websites, chatbox, and email, sharing computer screen, clicking on malicious links, and having iCloud backup enabled, among others, could all lead to bad actors gaining access to users' funds.

Meanwhile, some users blamed MetaMask for storing the seed phrase on iCloud, asking for a quick fix.

""The fact that Metamask stores your phrase on iCloud is a major security risk especially when it comes to social engineering and how large the industry is,"" one Twitter user said. ""Metamask needs to disable that feature or make it tougher for malicious actors.""

2022-03-11,Ultimate Beginner’s Guide to CoolMining: the Only GameFi that ... - NewsBTC,"As an open-world mining simulation GameFi, the mission of CoolMining – an on-chain simulation game that is built upon real-life hash power, is to empower the community to participate in PoW mining in a decentralized manner. It was first launched on KCC (KuCoin Community Chain).

Starting off the year of 2022, while the crypto market is waiting to pick up, NFT and on chain games took the lead of an active rebound – Axie’s native game Token SLP has risen for six consecutive days, while PlaceWar’s governance Token PLACE has risen for four consecutive days, with the highest single-day rise once by 73%. Although the overall market sentiment seems to be experiencing setbacks, investors remain positive since the metaverse narrative has huge potential.

Debuting as KuCoin’s first IGO (initial game offering) project (on February 25, KuCoin officially announced that CoolMining will be open for trading), CoolMining has been widely welcomed by the market. During the pre-IGO activity on February 21, the CoolMining tokens valued at $180,000 was sold out only within 3 minutes at the price of $0.6 per token, joining Axie Infinity as the most popularized project.

In addition to the collaboration with KuCoin, CoolMining has also announced the cooperation with BitMain, Antminer Pool, a21x as well as a set of other leading institutions, significantly accelerating the build-up of the CoolMining ecosystem.

This article is the ultimate guide for beginner miners and players to start and enter the CoolMining GameFi world.

What is CoolMining and Its Birth

14 years after Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Whitepaper though, ordinary computational equipment lost their places in the mining scene due to the short of specialized mining rigs, which are expensive to purchase, maintain and operate. The current crypto mining landscape is consisted of 4 major types of players in a highly centralized way: mining rigs manufacturers, big miners, mining farms and mining pools who jointly control the majority of global bitcoin hashrate.

CoolMining is an on-chain simulation game based on real-life hash power. In the CoolMining world, there are a variety of ways for players to possess computing power. Various occupations are also available for players to choose, players are able to participate as stakers, miners or mining site owners, immersing themselves into the mining world vividly from different perspectives. The most exciting part is – it is the first Gamefi project with NFTs backed by real life assets. All hash power in the game corresponds to real-life hashrate. Every player has a chance to earn BTC rewards via playing the CoolMining game.

In order to enable all junior miners to enjoy an authentic mining experience without having to bear the noisy environment and complex operation one could encounter in real crypto mining process, the CoolMining project decides turn mining, a hard-core and complicated business, into a much more fun journey – which is the simulation game based on blockchain.

How to start playing CoolMining

There are two ways to start playing the CoolMining game:

Staking through mining pool. Put CoolHash, the hashrate token, into the mining pool to “connect” to the BTC network and start earning BTC rewards. This is currently available on the CoolMining website. Users can also obtain CoolHash token at Mojitoswap. Mining using miner NFTs. Players need to collect miner accessories first to customise miners. The miners help to accelerate mining by adding hashrate bonus, which will translate into higher BTC rewards for players.

All of CoolMining’s gaming mechanism is realised on-chain through smart contracts that are audited by Certik.

What is CoolHash and CoolGas

CoolHash is an ERC-20 token, representing real world hash power. Every CoolHash is equivalent to 0.01TH/s hash power. It is also the governance token of CoolMining Community.

CoolGas is another ERC-20 token working as the utility token in the GameFi ecosystem with unlimited supply. It is the mining reward token as well as the energy consuming token. Miners consume CoolGas tokens as the mining rigs operate. At the same time, miners get BTC rewards and CoolGas as mining rewards. In addition, mining hosts will receive a portion of CoolGas paid by hosted miners as custodial fees.

Both CoolHash and CoolGas tokens are available for purchase on MojitoSwap.

The CoolPart and CoolMiner NFTs

In CoolMining, there are two types of NFTs, one is CoolPart NFT and the other is CoolMiner NFT.

The CoolPart NFT will be minted in the form of Mystery Boxes via official website. There will be 4 types of CoolPart NFTs, assigning different attributes to CoolMiner NFT:

Hash Board: determines the hash rates of a miner

Control Board: determines the reward bonus of a miner

Power Supply Unit: determines the CoolGas consumption level of a miner

Cooling System: determines the transaction fee level when redeeming rewards

At least one hash board and at most four non-duplicated components, one from each type, are required to mint a miner.

As for CoolMiner NFT, players can get it either through minting using CoolPart NFTs or purchasing CoolMiner NFTs directly in the CoolMarket (the official NFT marketplace of CoolMining).

All CoolMiner NFTs are unique miners minted by players by combining CoolPart NFTs together. The performance of the miners is determined by the attributes and rarity levels of composing parts.

What’s more exciting is, players can even disassemble the minted miners into original components.

Mystery Boxies

CoolPart Mystery Boxes will be available to mint with CoolHash via the project’s official website.

There are two type of mystery boxes: Essential Hash Parts and Elective Hash Parts.

Essential Hash Parts contain only hash boards while Elective Hash Parts include control board, power supply unit and cooling system. Players would need at least one hash board and at most four non-duplicated components, one from each type to mint a miner.

Essential Hash Parts Mystery Boxes will include hash board CoolPart NFTs of three rarity levels, R/SR/SSR. The hash board determines the fundamental hash power of a miner.

Elective Hash Parts Boxes will have control board, power supply unit and cooling system CoolPart NFTs of three rarity levels, R/SR/SSR, respectively. Different components create different bonus effect on miners’ performance. The bounties largely have to do with reward bonus, CoolGas consumption and transaction fee.

Each part has three level of rarities and assigns different attributes to the miners. For more details, visit: https://docs.coolmining.io/how-coolmining-works/mystery-boxes

What is CoolMart

CoolMart is the official NFT marketplace for players to exchange mystery boxes, miner accessories and miners.

Players can acquire better accessories through trading to modify or upgrade their miners, enhancing performance and maximising rewards.

CoolMining Gameplay

Staking

All CoolHash token holders can be stakers to earn BTC rewards. By design, CoolHash tokens represent ownership of corresponding hash power. Stake CoolHash in the mining pool indicates the underlying hash power is connected to the bitcoin network and participating in POW mining to earn BTC rewards.

Total BTC rewards is calculated based on real world total hashrate. Rewards corresponding to CoolMining hashrate will be distributed to BTC rewards pool on a 24h basis after cost of production is deducted and accumulating. Players are able to claim their share of the BTC rewards anytime.

Mining

In order to start mining using a miner, players need to own a miner either by purchasing on CoolMart or building a customized miner in the Miners Lab.

When players have thier own miners, either via minting or purchasing, they have new hashrate credentials. Holding CoolMiner NFTs means the ownership of corresponding hash power. Players need to stake CoolMiner NFTs to boot the miners and start earning.

During miners operation, players need to prepay CoolGas as energy cost to earn BTC rewards and the mining rewards in CoolGas.

(Note: Miners Lab is an experimental site for players, where one is able to inspect accessories and miners in stock and willingly assemble or disassemble to maximise one’s return, and vice versa. For assembled miners, players can first disassemble the miners into its original components and replace with better accessories to achieve optimal results.)

Miners Hosting

Miners hosting is for the most advanced players in CoolMining to play. Mining sites’ business model is to provide miner slots to help accelerate rewards earning and meanwhile charge miners fixed portion of rewards as custodial fees. For more details, visit the Whitepaper.

Rewards Claiming

BTC Rewards

BTC rewards pool is calculated real-time based on the aggregated hashrate in the real world. Rewards corresponding to CoolMining staked hashrate will be distributed to BTC rewards pool every 24-hour after cost of production is deducted. Rewards accumulate over time and players are able to claim BTC rewards at any time.

CoolGas Rewards

CoolGas is calculated as mining rewards. Certain amount of CoolGas will be mined each day to intensify miners’ participation, which then will be distributed to players according to the hashrate at stake in proportion to the total hashrate in the ecosystem.

Conclusion

While the overall crypto market continues to see fluctuation, investors seem to favor quality GameFi projects like Axie and CoolMining.

For people who are passionate about BTC mining but not sure where and how to start, the CoolMining is definitely worth a try. You earn while you play and can learn basic mining knowledge and skills like an actual miner. .

2022-03-18,How to Invest in Gold via Cryptocurrency? Meet the Gold-Pegged Tokens - CryptoPotato,"Gold is a precious metal used in many industries, but it’s also a well-known investment product and a historical hedge against economic turmoil and inflation. Widely regarded as a risk-off asset, gold prices tend to perform best in a challenging financial environment – during a crisis, wars, shakedowns, and whatnot.

Gold-Pegged Cryptocurrency: Video Tutorial

What is a Gold-Pegged Cryptocurrency?

Gold-pegged cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are a derivative asset class that allows users to purchase, trade, and receive exposure to gold without having to worry about physical storage and custody. They remove inconveniences related to transport, transferability, as well as associated illiquidity.

In the traditional world, they correspond to gold ETFs and CFDs, which track the price of gold without having to physically own it.

There are numerous cryptocurrencies that are pegged to gold in one way or another, and they are backed in different ratios, depending on the project itself.

In this article, we will take a look at some of the more popular gold-pegged cryptocurrencies.

Pros and Cons of Investing in Gold-Backed Cryptocurrency

As with every other field, investing in gold-backed tokens carries some advantages and disadvantages. Let’s have a closer look at both.

Advantages of Gold-Pegged Tokens

First things first, most gold-backed tokens exist as tokens built on the ERC-20 token standard and, as such, are easily transferable and tradeable on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges.

They remove the illiquidity of physical gold by allowing users to trade them at any time, so long as they have access to an exchange. Another benefit is that they can be split and fractionalized, allowing investors to own smaller portions and not necessarily require them to invest a large sum of money.

Gold-pegged tokens also carry some other benefits, widely associated with cryptocurrencies – they are easily stored and transferable – unlike physical gold.

Gold-pegged cryptocurrencies can potentially be bought via decentralized exchanges. Hence, their holders can buy them without any measures of KYC (compared to CFDs and ETFs).

Disadvantages of Gold-Pegged Tokens

The fact that they are a derivative product also carries some risks. One of them is that investors don’t necessarily have direct ownership over the gold that their tokens are pegged to, although this might differ in certain projects which allow physical redemption.

Moreover, they are reliant on centralized service providers which manage the storage of the physical gold that backs the tokens, and this is completely out of the investors’ hands.

Because most of them are ERC-20 Ethereum-based tokens, each purchase or transfer of the token might carry high gas fees.

Compared to traditional gold contracts for difference (CFDs), gold-pegged cryptocurrencies are a lot less liquid as the market for them is a lot smaller compared to the legacy one.

Another difference from CFDs is the fact that smart contracts are vulnerable to exploits. The chances are very minor in this case, however, any smart contract carries a non-zero chance of failure.

Top Gold-Pegged Cryptocurrencies

While there might be quite a few cryptocurrencies that claim to be pegged to gold, based on our research, only two are worth looking into. These are Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT). Both tokens are issued by well-known companies with a proven history in the field and boast somewhat sufficient trading volume. The rest of the gold-pegged cryptocurrencies fail to deliver substantial liquidity, and their respective websites haven’t been updated for years, which is a red flag.

Paxos Gold (PAXG)

Token symbol: PAXG

Market Cap (as of March 2022): $550 million

Top exchanges listed on: Binance, Uniswap, FTX, KuCoin, Kraken

At the time of this writing, in March 2022, PAXG is the biggest gold-pegged cryptocurrency by means of total market cap, which sits at around $550 million. It also boasts the highest daily traded volume.

According to the project’s official whitepaper, each PAXG token “represents one fine troy ounce of physical gold from a specific serialized gold bar.” Interestingly enough, if someone owns enough PAXG to represent an entire gold bar, they are able to redeem the tokens for the physical gold bar.

The benefit of this is that ownership can be divided into units of up to 18 decimal points, allowing people to get exposure to miniscule amounts of gold. The token exists through Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, making it easily portable across the network.

It’s also worth noting that the Paxos Trust Company – the issuer of PAXG 0 is a regulated financial institution, as well as a qualified custodian. It’s a state-chartered company that’s regulated by the NYDFS (New York State Department of Financial Services) and is required to uphold the highest standards when it comes to protecting customer assets. Moreover, the NYDFS also regulates PAXG itself.

Tether Gold (XAUt)

Token symbol: XAUt

Market Cap (as of March 2022): $210 million

Top exchanges listed on: FTX, Bitfinex, Uniswap

CryptoPotato reported back in January 2021 that Tether – the company behind the most widely-used stablecoin (USDT), has launched a new digital asset ticked XAUt. In essence, the token, which is based on the ERC-20 and Tron’s TRC-20 standard – also represents one troy fine ounce of gold on a London Good Delivery bar.

Holders of XAUt are able to obtain undivided ownership rights to gold on the specified gold bars. Their allocation is identifiable through a unique serial number, weight, and purity.

Per the documentation, XAUt holders are also allowed to check the details of the gold bars that are associated with their addresses at any time through the website.

To make a redemption request in the form of physical gold, users need to have completed the TG Commodities Limited’s verification process. This is the company that issues the tokens. Otherwise, the token is tradeable on some popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as FTX and Bitfinex.

Conclusion

All in all, there are many gold-pegged cryptocurrencies, but only the above two meet liquidity and reputation criteria.

Investing in gold is long considered a rather safe effort, and it’s also a well-known hedge (protection) against inflation and tumultuous economic environments.

Of course, as with any other investment, this also carries the risk of capital loss. With this in mind, none of the above should be considered financial advice.

2022-04-13,Best Crypto Wallets - Yahoo News,"These devices from CoolWallet, Ledger, ShapeShift, and Trezor can help you securely manage your portfolio

Left to right: Trezor Model One, Ledger Nano X, CoolWallet S, ShapeShift KeepKey, and Ledger Nano S crypto wallets.

By Nicholas De Leon

If you buy and sell cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, you might appreciate the privacy and security afforded by a good crypto wallet.

While there are plenty of free software tools to help you manage your portfolio, a physical device (known as a hardware wallet or “cold storage”) offers certain advantages.

With a hardware wallet, you and only you are in control of your portfolio.

To send and receive crypto, you simply connect the device, which often resembles a thumb drive, to a computer or laptop using USB or Bluetooth. And when you’re finished, you promptly disconnect it, preventing a cybercriminal from, say, accessing a browser-based wallet simply by hacking your laptop.

Yes, the exchanges that handle transactions can and do get hacked. Does this happen every day? No, but it happens often enough that there’s a Wikipedia entry dedicated to tracking high-profile incidents. Recent examples include the January 2022 theft of cryptocurrency worth $30 million from Crypto.com; the reported December 2021 theft of $150 million worth of crypto from BitMart; and the reported September 2020 theft of $275 million worth of crypto from KuCoin.

Heck, people are still trying to claw back losses from the 2014 attack on the vaunted Mt. Gox exchange, which resulted in the loss of some 744,000 bitcoins, worth nearly $30 billion today. Yes, that’s billion with a B.

Many reputable cryptocurrency exchanges do offer some insurance to protect consumers from such hacks, but it’s not backed by the FDIC like a bank account.

For some people, a hardware wallet offers yet another layer of protection, sheltering your currency from being frozen or seized by others. As the saying goes, ""not your keys, not your coins.""

And so, a hardware wallet is a simple, effective way to safeguard your crypto. But when you do a Google search for “hardware wallet,” you end up with millions of results (125 million, to be precise), making it hard to find the model that best meets your needs and budget. With so many options, where do you even begin?

Well, start here.

To help the crypto curious make a more informed decision, we purchased a handful of popular wallets, reviewing what they do and how they work. You can scroll down for detailed directions on how to use a crypto wallet.

We selected five crypto wallets, ranging in price from roughly $50 to $150: the CoolWallet S, the Ledger Nano S, the Ledger Nano X, the ShapeShiftKeepKey, and the Trezor Model One.

Those are the options frequently mentioned in online discussions. They generally receive favorable reviews on retailer websites, too. They all get the job done, more or less, but I found the Ledger Nano X to be the best of the bunch, offering the strongest combination of features and ease-of-use. Conversely, the CoolWallet S is the hardest to recommend, owing mostly to an unpolished user experience and its unique method of charging.

Editor's Choice: Ledger Nano X

Photo: Ledger

Price: $149

Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS

Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth

The Nano X is the most expensive wallet we reviewed, but its wide compatibility and highly polished software give it an edge over the competition.

The device is compact in size, but the display is large enough to provide letters, numbers, and symbols that are comfortable to read and the two large, physical buttons, used to confirm transactions made in the Ledger Live app, are easy to use. The wallet can connect to a computer or smartphone via USB-C or Bluetooth.

Ledger Live is compatible with most major platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. With it, you can buy crypto with U.S. dollars, swap cryptocurrencies—say, bitcoin for Ethereum—and send and receive crypto between wallets.

In addition to bitcoin and Ethereum, the Nano X supports Monero, Polkadot, and Ripple (XRP), among others.

The Value Pick: ShapeShift KeepKey

Price: $49

Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Android (all via web app)

Connectivity: USB Micro

If you don’t need wireless connectivity or Apple iOS compatibility, this is a solid wallet at a nice price.

It has an easy-to-read display—the largest in our evaluation—and a single physical button that’s comfortable to press. And thanks to its use of a web app, the model is compatible with even Linux and Chrome OS. (The company recommends using Chrome or the Brave web browser with the app.)

Using KeepKey with an Android device may require a separate cable or dongle; I plugged an ordinary USB-C dongle into the wallet to connect it to a Google Pixel smartphone. There is no wireless connectivity.

A wide variety of cryptocurrencies are supported, including ShapeShift’s own Fox token.

The web app is easy to use, letting you send and receive crypto from wallet to wallet or buy new crypto from select exchanges. You can also use it to swap the crypto you own for another form of crypto, choosing from a wide selection that includes ShapeShift’s own Fox token.

Compact Pick: Trezor Model One

Photo: SatoshiLabs

Price: $70

Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS

Connectivity: USB Micro

The Model One offers solid functionality and wide platform compatibility, but the design is not ideal for everyone.

The device is shaped like a key fob, and has a small display and two small rectangular buttons, which are quite close together, making for a somewhat cramped experience, at least for me. If you have smaller hands, you may not have that problem.

The model feels somewhat cheap and delicate, too, compared with other crypto wallets. It tends to jangle and rattle around when you use it.

There are two ways to use the Model One: You can work with the dedicated Trezor Suite app (available for Linux, Mac, and Windows) or a web app in a browser.

There’s no functional difference between the two options, but the web app allows those with Android and Chrome OS devices to use the wallet, too. And since the Model One can’t connect wirelessly, you’ll need a dongle if your phone or laptop doesn’t have a built-in USB-A port. I used a USB-C dongle for a Google Pixel.

The Model One supports many popular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s not compatible with more obscure cryptocurrencies, such as Monero and Cardano, but Trezor’s $215 Model T, which we did not evaluate, is.

Both apps have clean interfaces that allow you to send and receive crypto, buy crypto with U.S. dollars from select exchanges, and swap crypto in different forms. There’s even an option to spend your crypto on gift cards from retailers, including Amazon and Walmart.

Ledger Value Pick: Ledger Nano S

Photo: Ledger

Price: $59

Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

Connectivity: USB Micro

Think of this as a pared-down version of the Nano X. Price-wise, it’s competitive with other wallets, but it beats most in my estimation, because the Ledger Live software is so clean and straightforward.

The model is small in size, making it a little harder to read than the Nano X, and lacks Bluetooth, so it can’t be used with an iOS device. But Android phone owners are fine, as long as they have an appropriate cable or dongle. I was able to connect the Ledge Nano S to my Google Pixel with an ordinary USB-C dongle.

As with the Nano X, the Ledger Live app allows you to easily send, receive, and swap crypto. It also supports most of the major cryptocurrencies.

The Thin Pick: Cool Wallet S

Photo: Nicholas De Leon/Consumer Reports

Price: $99

Platforms: Android, iOS

Connectivity: Bluetooth

The Cool Wallet S works fine, but it’s hard to justify the $99 price.

I like the model’s design, which resembles a credit card and easily fits into your “real” wallet. But there’s much more about the device that I didn’t like.

The Cool Wallet S is the only option we evaluated that requires its own proprietary charger, for example. If you lose it, your only recourse is to buy a new one for $40.

There’s also no desktop app, which means you’re forced to use a smartphone or tablet. Maybe you’re okay with that, but I prefer to use my computer.

And, finally, the iOS app that I used in my evaluation sent me several Chinese-language push notifications, which was strange, considering the app itself is in English.

In the end, though, all the expected functionality is here, including the ability to send and receive crypto like bitcoin and Ethereum, so if you’re a fan of the credit card-like design, go for it.

How Crypto Wallets Work

When you use a crypto wallet, the currency is stored on the blockchain, not the device itself. That means you don’t lose your crypto if you misplace your wallet. More on that in a minute.

Think of it like using a multifactor authenticator to log in to a bank account. You initiate a transaction via an app on your computer or smartphone and then authorize the transaction with the wallet.

To illustrate further, let’s use the Ledger Nano X, our Editor’s Choice.

The wallet is roughly the length and width of a stick of gum and about a centimeter thick. It has a built-in display and two physical buttons. After opening the packaging, you download the corresponding app, Ledger Live, from Nano’s website.

After confirming that the wallet worked with the iOS app, I mostly used the Windows app in my testing. I like to use a computer instead of my iPhone for “important” tasks such as paying bills and managing money, but that’s a personal preference. If you’re more of a phone person, you want to choose a wallet that offers full mobile support.

After you’ve installed Ledger Live, you plug the Nano X into your computer or pair it with your smartphone. The app then instructs you to create a four- to eight-character PIN on the device itself, using the two physical buttons to scroll back and forth on the display and pick each numeral.

(The hardware wallets we tested all have physical buttons, which are also used to confirm any transactions you make in the app.)

You will have to enter the PIN every time you connect your Nano X to your computer.

Next comes the most cumbersome part of the setup process: the creation and confirmation of a 24-word recovery phrase.

All wallets use such a phrase. Ledger recommends that you write it down on a small piece of paper included in the Nano X packaging. I’d go one step further and suggest you place it in a very secure location, like a small safe or fireproof security box. If someone were to obtain it, they’d have total access to your crypto.

To create the recovery phrase, the Nano X shows you 24 words, one by one, on its built-in display. After you’ve viewed the words, you’re asked to confirm them. The Nano X literally asks “What’s word 1?” and gives you a choice of four words. You need to pick the correct one to verify it. Do that 23 more times and you’re good to go. Phew.

Now, if the Nano X is lost, stolen, or damaged, it’s no big deal. You can simply buy a new one and sign in to it using the 24-word recovery phrase. In fact, you can use the phrase with any wallet that adheres to a “chain code” standard known as BIP-32.

With setup complete, you can begin to use the wallet, perhaps buying some crypto from an exchange and sending it to your wallet. That way, your digital assets are stored securely offline with your device rather than on the exchange.

Sending and receiving crypto is pretty easy.

Continuing with the Ledger Nano X example, in the Ledger Live app, you simply select the “Receive” option on the left hand side, copy your wallet’s bitcoin address (which is a jumble of 34 characters) to your clipboard, then confirm on the device that you’re ready to receive. After that, you go to your exchange, paste in your Nano X address, and send the bitcoin on its way. That’s basically it.

In a few minutes, you get a confirmation in Ledger Live (and typically via a follow-up email from your exchange) saying the bitcoin was sent successfully.

Sending crypto from your Nano X to an exchange is similarly easy. In the Ledger Live app, you select “Send” on the left hand side, paste the bitcoin address and amount you want to send into a pop-up window, and confirm the send on the Nano X itself.

The process for doing just about anything with the Nano X (and the other wallets I tested) follows that pattern. You initiate a transaction in the app, then confirm that transaction on the crypto wallet.

2022-03-11,What are the Top DeFi Coins? - unblock.net,"Bitcoin (BTC) has helped to create a new world of opportunity in a wide variety of ways. The value present within bitcoin would compound and compound some more more before it would extend into more digital assets.

Now, we see that more financial services are coming into the picture to address the new world after the birth of bitcoin. From your DEX applications to the general ETH ecosystem, you are seeing a new paradigm that is trending.

While the US dollar has served as a critical foundation to the global financial system, it looks like crypto coins on applications like COMP and Bancor might be more beneficial. We could see an expansion of the crypto market via the defi market with defi protocols, ERC20 assets and various derivatives.

But while more are throwing around terms like the kyber network and the governance token, with MKR, sushiswap, synthetic (SNX), thorchain, WBTC, it is necessary to learn about the basic concepts before branching out.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a relatively new term in the cryptocurrency industry. By itself, the term refers to handling financial transactions over blockchain technology. But as opposed to executing simple funds transfers through cryptocurrency, these transactions take place in an automated manner to handle more complex financial agreements.

This opens blockchain technology’s use case for a variety of applications, where the role of intermediaries can be played by smart contracts or pre-arranged conditions. This makes DeFi an excellent way to execute loan agreements, actively trade cryptocurrencies, and participate in investments while ensuring fairness and preventing delays.

But before you can take part in a DeFi token investment, loan agreement, or trading programs, it is important to learn about the most important DeFi tokens that are currently available in the market. By learning what are the top DeFi coins and what their respective blockchains can do for you, you can know exactly how to benefit from this marvelous technology.

To help you through this learning curve, here are the top DeFi tokens that deserve your attention.

Widely known as the originator of flash loans in the cryptocurrency space, Aave stands apart with its innovative use of DeFi approaches. Through its uncollateralized flash loans that are entirely managed through smart contracts, the platform has practically redefined what DeFi can achieve for its users.

For those with sufficient finances, Aave presents an opportunity to lend their funds to other people for pre-agreed interest rates. For those who are looking for financing or loans, it carries the benefits of no collateral, faster approval, and low interest rates.

Instead of having a third-party to look after recovery or payments, Aave’s smart contracts also take care of these processes all on their own as a part of the flash loans mechanism. With its proven ability to lend, recover, and fulfill payments through its flash loans smart contracts, Aave has become one of the top DeFi tokens and lending solutions in the DeFi sector.

If you are looking for an answer to what are the top DeFi coins, Aave’s eponymous DeFi token stands out as one of the most logical responses to the inquiry. The token currently ranks within the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is available through popular exchanges including but not limited to Binance, Coinbase Exchange, FTX, Huobi Global, and KuCoin.

Chainlink operates as an oracle network over blockchain technology, which allows different blockchain networks to get their hands on off-chain information and processes in a secure manner. This allows the platform to provide essential support to smart contracts, which paves the way for different DeFi processes to come to life.

In order to help smart contracts execute accurate processes, Chainlink connects with oracles or external data point providers to extract information that exists off the blockchain. From there, it helps smart contracts use this data in order to enable their targeted and automated actions. Due to its emphasis on making smart contracts actually smart enough to replace intermediaries, Chainlink has become a prominent player in the DeFi token investment space.

This also makes Chainlink different from many other funds-transfer or value-transfer based DeFi tokens. With that being said, the critical purpose that it serves for the DeFi sector makes it a strong presence within this category of cryptocurrency-based transactions.

Chainlink’s token LINK currently ranks within the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap and can be purchased through exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase Exchange, FTX, Huobi Global, and KuCoin.

While looking for top DeFi tokens, the discussion cannot be completed without the mention of Dai (DAI). As one of the first applications of blockchain’s DeFi use case, Dai makes its mark due to being a stablecoin, where each Dai’s value is equal to 1 USD. This becomes possible due to an automated value-retention system that is powered by smart contracts.

Dai’s smart contracts allow you to benefit from collateralized loans that are powered by cryptocurrencies. Instead of having to go through extensive fees and exchange procedures, you can turn your cryptocurrency into DAI through these collateralized loans.

Over the years, Dai has positioned itself as a prominent stablecoin that steers clear of volatility and provides its holders with a significantly reliable digital asset. This function is supported by MakerDAO, which is Dai’s decentralized system of governance and makes it a highly sought after DeFi token investment.

Dai’s eponymous token currently ranks as a top 40 cryptocurrency by market cap in the world. The token is available on different exchanges including Binance, Coinbase Exchange, Huobi Global, and Kraken.

When you are learning about what are top the DeFi coins, you cannot complete the process without looking into Uniswap. By itself, Uniswap works as an automated market maker (AMM) or a decentralized exchange. Through its operations, the exchange allows investors and traders to purchase cryptocurrency through liquidity pools.

These liquidity pools lets you trade different pairs of cryptocurrencies without having to connect with an exchange-based account. This enables you to complete faster trades at lower fees, while also adding to your overall convenience.

This method of trading cryptocurrency through liquidity pools also works better with higher usability, which means that the more active traders there are on the platform, the better they can benefit from low trading fees. On the other hand, those who bring this liquidity to the table can also earn profits against related purchases that are completed on the platform.

Uniswap has its own token on the market by the name of UNI. It currently ranks within the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap and stands out as one of the top DeFi tokens. The token is available on exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase Exchange, FTX, Huobi Global, and KuCoin.

PancakeSwap is another popular DeFi platform that is specifically known for its decentralized exchange or automated market maker (AMM) solutions. Similar to Uniswap, PancakeSwap also allows its users to trade through liquidity pools and without the need for order books.

The main difference between both platforms is that PancakeSwap is based on the Binance Smart Chain, while Uniswap runs over the Ethereum blockchain. This makes PancakeSwap a more affordable DeFi token investment and platform in terms of transaction execution as well as related fees. For now, this also makes PancakeSwap faster than Uniswap.

Through PancakeSwap, you can easily trade your cryptocurrency pairs without having to pay sky high fees or putting up with delays to connect with another trader. The AMM or liquidity pool system also works better when more traders are actively using it. The ability to trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) further adds to the platform’s reliability as a long-term trading solution and a potentially successful investment.

PancakeSwap’s native token is CAKE, which currently ranks as one of the top 45 cryptocurrencies by market cap. CAKE is available to trade on popular cryptocurrency exchanges including but not limited to Binance, Bithumb, KuCoin, and Gate.io.

If you continue to wonder what are the top DeFi coins apart from the ones mentioned above, Terra would be the perfect addition to your learning journey. The DeFi platform has carved its niche in the cryptocurrency industry by offering stablecoins that are tied to fiat currency.

Apart from its main utility coin that is labeled LUNA, Terra also offers a host of stablecoins such as the TerraUSD (UST) that is tied to USD. By using a stablecoin for your trading and value transfer purposes, you can save yourself from the overall volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

If you want to hold cryptocurrency but don’t want to go through the experience of unprecedented price hikes and risk of massive price drops, Terra and its stablecoins provide you with an easy way to achieve this feat.

This lowers the risk of volatility while also providing you with more reliable value transfer mechanisms. These features make LUNA and UST some of the top DeFi tokens that are currently in circulation.

If you are interested in making a DeFi token investment in LUNA, you would be delighted to know that the token currently ranks as one of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is available on exchanges including but not limited to Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi Global, KuCoin, and Gate.io.

In your quest to learn what are the top DeFi coins, you may stumble upon Avalanche sooner or later. Avalanche is a smart contract-based blockchain development platform. Through its system, it gives its users all the tools and resources they need to create their own blockchains and decentralized applications (DApps).

This makes Avalanche similar to Ethereum, which is known for hosting Aave, UniSwap, and Dai on its blockchain platform. While Avalanche is not the first competitor for Ethereum and may not certainly be the last, its ability to support smart contract based applications makes it quite sought after for DeFi tokens and application development.

Within just a year of its launch, Avalanche has attracted various DeFi projects to its platform that range from yielding solutions to lending services. This makes Avalanche a highly prominent player in the DeFi segment.

As one of the top DeFi tokens, Avalanche’s AVAX currently stands within the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It can be traded on popular exchanges that include but are not limited to Binance, Coinbase Exchange, Huobi Digital, KuCoin, and Bitfinex.

While looking for an exciting DeFi token investment, you may also come face to face with Fantom. As one of many so-called Ethereum rivals, Fantom is taking up a challenge that has been tried by many blockchains that came before it. But to its credit, the platform holds fast transaction speeds and low transaction costs for actions executed over its platform.

Despite being a competitor to Ethereum, Fantom also stays compatible with the Ethereum blockchain through its Opera mainnet. With the ability to connect to Ethereum and vice versa, developers on the Ethereum blockchain can easily connect their DApps to Fantom and reap the rewards of its DeFi-centric support.

This mechanism as well as its asynchronous processing makes Fantom a compelling competitor and peer for Ethereum. This has given the platform quite some buzz. That is why, if you ask around about what are the top DeFi coins in the market at the moment, you may get Fantom as a surefire answer by many.

The Fantom token FTM currently stands within the top 35 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is also one of the top DeFi tokens overall. The token is available at popular exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, FTX, and Gemini.

The Graph may seem like the name of an old-world newspaper. But it is actually a modern and robust blockchain that allows for easy delivery of data and information. In simple words, the platform lets you inquire current data points from popular blockchains such as Ethereum and networks such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

By making these mechanisms possible, The Graph allows developers to obtain crucial information and details to power their own applications. This makes sure that those who want to develop new applications or create connections through an application programming interface (API) have the necessary information at hand.

With The Graph’s feature to create subgraphs, you can also organize and develop streamlined sections of information that can be shared publicly and across different applications. This facility by The Graph makes it a sought after solution for DeFi token investment. This is especially true for those applications that are still finding their footing in the sector and need up to date information to improve their solutions.

The Graph’s GRT token currently ranks as one of the top 40 cryptocurrencies and one of the most prominent DeFi tokens. It is available for trading through exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase Exchange, Huobi Global, and KuCoin.

The Quest to Find What Are the Top DeFi Coins May Continue Into the Future

While projects such as Aave, Uniswap, and Avalanche have made their presence known in quite an astonishing manner, the DeFi segment still remains in its infancy. This means that even though you can easily spot emerging stars within the sector, it is important that you keep an eye out for additional projects that are yet to break through the surface.

By paying attention to market movements and diversifying your investments, you can easily reap the rewards that modern DeFi solutions bring to the table. This ensures that you are not putting all your eggs in one basket, while also keeping an open mind to using new technologies and platforms without unnecessary hesitancy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vdW5ibG9jay5uZXQvdG9wLWRlZmktY29pbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

What Is Oasis Network?

One of the most significant barriers to blockchain technology adoption is the lack of privacy. However, the Oasis Network aims to solve that by being the first privacy-enabled Layer-1 blockchain focused on open finance, a responsible data economy, and Web3. In addition to privacy, the Oasis Network can also provide scalability and versatility with its two architectural component layers design.

By separating the execution and consensus layers, the Oasis Network fulfills its promises while maintaining fast transaction time. Its architecture is similar to that of Avalanche or Polkadot in that it connects multiple blockchains inside a single ecosystem.

Furthermore, the Oasis Network may be used to create private smart contracts that provide end-to-end data secrecy, ensuring data privacy while processing. Its features, along with privacy-focused, make it suitable for powering scalable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications while possibly extending open finance beyond cryptocurrency.

How Does Oasis Network Work?

As mentioned above, the Oasis Network has two architectural components, the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime Layer.

The Consensus Layer uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm run by a decentralized set of validator nodes. The validator nodes stake the native token, ROSE, in exchange for validating new blocks and collecting rewards.

The ParaTime Layer hosts runtime environments (ParaTimes) that express computation in a common state. Each ParaTime can be developed in isolation to meet the application’s specific needs and is entirely decentralized. There are currently three types of ParaTimes built by the Oasis team on the network:

Emerald ParaTime: This EVM compatible ParaTime was built to solve the problem of high fees and low throughput.

Cipher ParaTime: This confidential smart contract ParaTime allows high throughput, instant finality, low fees and includes privacy-preserving features.

Parcel ParaTime: This ParaTime enables “governance, confidential computation, and private analysis of data.”

The two layers are run separately, allowing multiple ParaTimes to process transactions without slowlying down the Consensus Layer. Furthermore, the network has broad support for confidential computing technology allowing data to be kept private while processing.

Partners & Team

The Oasis Network has impressive partnerships with established companies such as Meta AI (Formerly Facebook AI), Google Cloud Platform, and BMW Group.

Tokenomics

As mentioned, ROSE is the native token of the Oasis Network. It has a capped supply of 10 billion tokens. It is a utility token used for staking and delegating on the Oasis Consensus Layer and transaction fees in the ParaTime Layer.

The token is distributed as follows:

23.5% Staking Rewards

23% Backers

20% Core Contributors

18.5% Community & Ecosystem

10% Foundation Endowment

5% Strategic Partners & Reserve

Concerns:

Oasis Network is a promising project with great partnerships. The biggest concern is that they are not well-known and widely adopted blockchain protocols. They have also talked about supporting NFTs and Web3. However, most of their current live projects are focused on DeFi. Regardless, their technology is sound, so this might be a project worth keeping an eye on.

Where To Buy ROSE?

You can purchase ROSE through KuCoin exchange, similar to buying another cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you are willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current price and have your order filled almost immediately. If you are interested in purchasing ROSE, you can do so by visiting KuCoin, Gate.io, or Binance.US",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1vYXNpcy1uZXR3b3JrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-03-19,How To Buy UST Directly From Your Bank Account Using Kado Ramp - Cryptosrus,"In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to bypass the exchanges and directly onboard Terra DeFi from your bank account using Kado Ramp.

Covered:

What Is Kado Ramp

Downloading Terra Station Wallet

Converting USD To UST With Kado Ramp

What Is Kado Ramp?

Kado Ramp is an innovative Terra onramp service that allows you to buy UST directly from your bank account or debit/credit card without the need for a centralized exchange. This is a game-changer for Terra decentralized finance (DeFi) fanatics as it makes Terra one of the most accessible DeFi ecosystems out there. Instead of depositing USD to a centralized exchange, sending those funds to an intermediary to convert USD to UST, then depositing your UST to your Terra Station wallet, Kado Ramp takes away all those steps and makes depositing money directly from your bank account to Terra easier than ever before.

Keep in mind that Kado Ramp does have deposit limits for new users, but the general rule of thumb is the more you use Kado, the more you’ll be able to deposit.

Downloading Terra Station Wallet

To get started, you’ll need to download a Terra Station wallet, which you can do here. If you’re already a Terra native and have the wallet downloaded, then you can skip this step.

The first thing you need to do is create a new wallet. Click “connect” at the top right of the page, then select “new wallet.”

Type in a secure wallet name and password, then confirm your password. After that, you’ll be prompted with a 24-word seed phrase. Using pen and paper, write down your 24-word seed phrase exactly as it appears. Number each word to make verifying easier. It is absolutely crucial to keep this seed phrase in a safe place — it is your private key that will be used to recover your wallet in case anything happens to the device your Terra Station wallet is on.

After verifying your seed phrase, your Terra Station wallet should now be properly set up and ready to receive deposits.

Converting USD to UST With Kado Ramp

Now that you have your Terra Station wallet, it’s time to head over to Kado Ramp and sign up so you can directly buy UST using fiat USD from your bank account. The initial sign-up process will take a few extra minutes, but once you’ve got your account set up, onboarding Terra DeFi will never be easier than using Kado Ramp.

From the starting page, enter the amount of USD you want to deposit.

Keep in mind that Kado Ramp charges a flat $2 fee for deposits of any amount — a rather justified fee considering the fees you would normally have to spend transferring from centralized exchanges.

After entering the amount of UST you’d like to purchase, you’ll need to enter and confirm your email to set up your account.

Next up is probably your least favorite step — submitting KYC information.

Once you get verified, you can now start seamlessly buying UST without using any crypto exchanges! Kado Ramp has created an innovative new way to easily access stablecoins and is a highly-recommended option for any crypto native or Terra UST fanatic.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vaG93LXRvLWJ1eS11c3QtZGlyZWN0bHktZnJvbS15b3VyLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudC11c2luZy1rYWRvLXJhbXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Difficulty Of Valuing Crypto Projects

A thread about Network Effects and how to value digital assets: For Global Macro Investor, my independent research service, @Remi_Tetot and I spent a long time analysing various on chain data sets to see what were the key drivers of network price and network effects … — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) March 12, 2022

One of the trickiest aspects of investing in crypto is figuring out how to value crypto. Unlike equities which have price-to-earnings ratios — which too are flawed but that’s a different story — cryptocurrency projects as varied as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, and XRP are largely driven by speculation at this point.

Whether that’s because cryptocurrencies have no fundamental value or whether the royal we haven’t figured out how to value them is up to debate.

Network Effect

By yr 6 after the first 5m users, crypto has 295m participants and the internet had 119m. Crypto is growing at 137% a year while the internet grew at 76%. As I always say, this is the fastest adoption of technology the world has ever seen… pic.twitter.com/5hkaumxirS — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) March 12, 2022

Famed investment strategist Raoul Pal has proposed a way to think of the future value of several crypto projects. It centers around network adoption.

“Crypto is growing at 137% a year while the internet grew at 76%. As I always say, this is the fastest adoption of technology the world has ever seen…” Pal said via Twitter. He also estimates that crypto should grow to 1.2 billion users by 2025, and 5 billion by 2030.

As of of December 2021, crypto had around 295 million users. Users, though, don’t necessarily mean that every project will benefit.

What Drives Adoption?

Ok, but what drives this adoption? Clearly, everyone owning a part of the network creates alliance of interests which leads to exponential growth… And, simply put, blockchain is just a better way of doing things in the digital, exponential age. — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) March 12, 2022

“We now know that Metcalfe’s Law is the key valuation model for digital assets but its a hard formula to apply and Im a bit of an idiot so I wanted to find an approximation that helps understand network value. After a lot of work, trial and error, this is the answer I found: THE VALUE OF A DIGITAL ASSET NETWORK IS DRIVEN BY DAILY TRANSACTION VOLUMES (IN DOLLARS OR UNITS OF VALUE) X NUMBER OF ACTIVE USERS

Using that formula, Pal applied it to several cryptocurrencies. The results for Bitcoin and Ethereum were hardly surprising.

When you apply this formula to digital asset networks, you get a really good fit. Here is Bitcoin #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/PRJES0QjGe — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) March 12, 2022

Both networks obviously have been adopted in their own ways. BTC has its core fanbase that uses it constantly, while ETH is the reserve currency of Ethereum DeFi and NFTs.

Two other projects Pal looked at, though, tell us more about the health and future of crypto.

After a hot start, Polkadot has cooled off considerably since its launch. Not to mention, development on Polkadot isn’t getting as much attention as Ethereum or Cardano — though DOT features a surprising amount of play-to-earn gaming development — but using Pal’s formula its showing significant growth.

It even works for XRP.. pic.twitter.com/YXveEC8u1m — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) March 12, 2022

And, most surprising of all is XRP. The much-maligned Ripple coin has struggled for most of the last calendar year.

2022-04-19,S&P 500 Signals End Of Bitcoin Correction; Bull Rally Is Imminent ... - Cryptosrus,"Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 may not be a good thing, but these metrics suggest that the bull case is growing stronger than ever.

Covered:

S&P 500 vs. Bitcoin From A Technical Perspective

Stepping Back From The Technicals

It’s popular to be a bear right now in the cryptoverse, and typically that kind of sentiment signals that a bottom is near. With not much bullish technical analysis out there these days, it’s refreshing to see one technical analyst making the contrarian case for another Bitcoin bull rally. He’s pulled out some interesting correlations to the S&P 500, and it might just prove that Bitcoin is ready to rebound.

S&P 500 vs. Bitcoin From A Technical Perspective

The technical analyst Aurelien Ohayon is one of the only Bitcoin TA guys left out there, and he’s finding some very interesting correlations between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 (SPX). Let’s break down what he’s seeing so you can decide whether you agree or not with the bull case being made.

“At every BTC blow-off top, the 2W-CMO (Chande momentum oscillator) of #SPX makes Higher Highs before the final Blow-off, while it does not make any Higher Highs before BTC’s last Rounding top.

It is the SPX wave structure strength that determines that of BTC.”

Before digging into what we’re looking at, let’s first take note of an interesting higher-level observation. The S&P500 (underneath Bitcoin price action) appears to be climbing in a steeper and steeper fashion, which falls in line with the exponential rate of our technological innovation over the past decade. The Chande Momentum Oscillator also reflects the increase in momentum, as it’s printed steeper higher lows throughout the past three bull cycles.

As noted by Ohayon, each breakdown of the SPX tend to line up with a much larger Bitcoin correction following its local tops in the market cycle. Now, we can note that Bitcoin bull rallies end after blow-off tops correlated with a higher high in the CMO, but when looking at the two-week CMO today, it has failed to create a higher high, which corresponds with the rounding top we saw in Bitcoin about one year ago. Now that the CMO has fallen back down and created another local low (as indicated in green), it may just be telling us that not only is the S&P 500 ready to rally again, but so is Bitcoin.

What makes Ohayon’s analysis unique is how he pairs two separate assets together with indicators from each. So rather than showing Bitcoin’s price alongside its own stochastic relative strength index (RSI), Ohayon showcases another interesting correlation between the Bitcoin price chart paired with the S&P 500 Stochastic RSI.

“When the Weekly Stochastic RSI K-line of the S&P500 leaves the blue zone, a BTC bottom has been reached, followed by a huge bull run. The bottoms of 2011, 2015, 2018, 2020 were found.

It just left the blue zone.”

Bitcoin’s correlation to traditional finance can be a good thing when traditional markets turn bullish again. And as pointed out by Ohayon, the S&P 500’s weekly Stochastic RSI just left the “blue zone” again, which typically correlates with a strong bounceback in stocks. We’ll just have to see if history repeats itself once more.

Lastly, zooming in a bit closer to today, let’s look at Bitcoin and the S&P 500 from a more straightforward TA perspective, side by side.

Both structures are forming bullish descending broadening wedges, which when retested from the upside, typically lead to further price appreciation. The relative strength index (RSI), which measures the overbought and oversold conditions of an asset, also just happens to be forming progressive higher lows. Bullish? Or just a fake-out?

Taking A Step Back From The Technicals

We are at a quite pivotal time in the traditional and crypto markets alike. As inflation concerns grow by the day, paired with rising geopolitical tensions abroad and less money to spend for the average consumer, there’s an awful lot of reason to be bearish these days. However, when the majority of people see things in the market the same way, the market typically tends to humble them. We’ve seen major financial players all call for an impending recession, but it should make you wonder whether something so seemingly obvious is coming when it’s being shouted from the rooftops.

This doesn’t mean that a recession isn’t on the way for financial markets, but the timing of which it may come just might be what throws everyone off.

As discussed in previous posts, crypto market cycles are lengthening over time.

The dream is still alive my friends #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/SX5bzesoEn — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) March 28, 2022

With the correlations between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin shown by Ohayon, it certainly makes one wonder why we haven’t seen further capitulation just yet. Despite all the bearish catalysts overhead, Bitcoin and crypto have been holding relatively strong for such a nascent asset class.

Is it possible that we have yet to see one more run-up in asset prices that inevitably causes the bubble to burst, leading the economy into a recession, or did the bubble burst last year, we just haven’t caught up to that realization yet? There’s certainly a case to be made for both sides, and only the future will reveal which view is correct.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vcy1idWxsLXJhbGx5LWlzLWltbWluZW50LXNheXMtYW5hbHlzdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-06,Node for Node: Which Chains Are The Most Decentralized? - Cryptosrus,"Quantifying decentralization is difficult, but knowing the basics is key. Here, we rank 10 top chains by node count to see which chain is most decentralized — or maybe, the least centralized.

Covered:

Gauging Decentralization

How to Count Nodes

So Who’s the Winner?

Gauging Decentralization

There are a number of factors that are determinants in judging a blockchain’s decentralization. While many chains claim to be decentralized, it is important to understand the basics and do your own research to separate the wheat from the chaff.

There are two main elements to decentralization. The first is token supply distribution. That is how much of the supply is allocated to teams, venture capital, foundations, insiders, public sale, and rewards. The more supply that is allocated to teams, insiders, and venture capital, the less decentralized the chain is.

Second is the number of nodes, stake pools, or validators on the network. (These all serve the same purpose more or less). The total number of nodes is the best proxy for determining the security of the chain. The more nodes, the more difficult it is to attack the network or shut it down.

More nodes spread across more unique locations is optimal for decentralization. If the supply is concentrated and held by a few nodes (most nodes in proof-of-stake require holding x amount of coins), then these nodes can attack the network and steal funds. This is called a 51% attack.

How to Count Nodes

Keep in mind that the way we count nodes does not involve the number of people delegating their stake to a node or running a one-click node. This metric is gauged by individual computers (people/entities) running the software to process and validate blocks. This is oftentimes called running a “full node.”

Because of variations between different types of nodes depending on the chain, and the way that some of these chains are set up (consensus), whether it’s Terra connecting to Cosmos IBC, etc., it becomes difficult to judge one against another. Still, it is possible to see how many nodes are participating in consensus, that is, validating blocks. This is what we are looking for.

Because we are looking at proof-of-stake networks (sans Ethereum), you would ideally want to check “how many stake pools, validators, or nodes exist on the network, how much of the coins circulating supply is staked and what portion of the validators or stake pools are run by the founders of the coin, rather than public entities and individuals.”

The issue is finding and aggregating this information can be difficult. Sorting through a blockchain’s ‘explorer’ is the best way. The point to drive home about nodes on proof-of-stake is to understand that the reason these chains can be so fast is that they require quite large computational resources (hardware) to run a node. The more RAM required, the fewer nodes there will be. As an example, see here for the hardware requirements for Solana.

So Who’s the Winner?

Because it would be difficult to aggregate all the different data from the many PoS chains that exist, we have compiled node/validator/staking pool counts from 10 different chains. Algorand, Avalanche, Cardano, Elrond, Ethereum, Fantom, Polkadot, Polygon, Terra, and Solana. It is very helpful to understand our methodology by understanding the difference between delegated proof-of-stake, bonded proof-of-stake, and the other less common types, see here.

Keep in mind some of these chains, with the way their consensus works, makes it unclear which nodes are actually validating the transactions. For example, a sharded chain like Elrond has 3192 active validators but only 221 nodes. This is presumably a case where the 3192 validators are staking to the 221 nodes, i.e., a stake pool. Here we would take the node count because you can’t validate a block without running a node.

All of these nuances make it less than an exact science to rank. Nevertheless, we have pulled the data from all the explorers/documents for the node counts, which will be hyperlinked in the name of each chain listed below. Here is our ranking.

10. Solana (1,672 validators)** Delegated Proof of Stake

9. Fantom (66 validators) Delegated Proof of Stake

8. Polygon (80 validators) Delegated Proof of Stake

7. Terra (133 validators *capped) Bonded Proof of Stake

6. Elrond (221 nodes) Secure Proof of Stake

5. Polkadot (256 validators *capped) Nominated Proof of Stake

4. Avalanche (1,439 validators) Delegated Proof of Stake

3. Algorand (2,005 nodes) Pure Proof of Stake

2. Cardano (3,013 pools/nodes) Delegated Proof of Stake

Ethereum (5,121 full nodes) Proof of Work

Well, there you have it, folks. It is always important to ensure you research these metrics mentioned above. As Warren Buffet said, “never invest in what you don’t understand.”

**Solana is #10 is due to the fact that 21 nodes control ~33% of the stake.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vbm9kZS1mb3Itbm9kZS13aGljaC1jaGFpbnMtYXJlLXRoZS1tb3N0LWRlY2VudHJhbGl6ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-20,7 crypto apps that allow Africans to participate in the global economy - Benjamindada.com,"These apps allow African payment method and provide learning materials for crypto enthusiasts who want to delve into the cryptocurrency space.

Africans have always struggled with infrastructural problems, which have made financial services less accessible. This has been a major cause of more than 57% of the population remaining unbanked.



These infrastructural problems is making Africa a perfect vector for cryptocurrencies, which only require a smartphone to access and offer Africans a shot at the global economy. In 2019, Chainalysis estimated that of the $48 billion remittance payments to Sub-Saharan Africa $562 million were facilitated by cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency platforms bypass traditional banking services by introducing decentralised peer-to-peer lending services. They can also help level the economic playing field by expanding finance options to underserved customer markets.



Indeed, cryptocurrencies are well-positioned to address a number of economic challenges in the region, from reducing financing gaps for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) sectors to facilitating the transfer of remittances, to reaching the unbanked.



Although cryptocurrencies are not yet recognized as legal tender by most countries, it has continued to gain massive adoption (especially after COVID-19). People use it to store value, trade and as investments.



These activities are usually available on crypto exchanges so Benjamindada.com compiled a list of cryptocurrency exchanges available to Sub-Saharan Africans.

Each of these crypto exchange platforms (available as apps) have offices in Africa, have a large daily trading volume or are founded by Africans. And of course, they allow African payment method. The platforms also provide learning materials for crypto enthusiasts who want to delve into the cryptocurrency space.

2022-03-03,"BlockPad Rebrands to Blockius, Expands Focus on DeFi Industry - Digital Journal","Road Town, BVI, 3rd March 2022, ZEXPRWIRE, The disruptive blockchain startup BlockPad has announced that it is rebranding from BlockPad to Blockius.

Blockius is now a multichain network of decentralized applications that acts as a gateway to the Web 3.0 ecosystem. It aims to prevent and reduce the existing scams and rug pulls from the crypto space by offering a suite of intuitive products with compatibility of multiple blockchains.

Blockius ecosystem includes investor dashboard, token vesting, LP locker, staking dashboard and LP mining. It effectively safeguards investors from a range of projects that might pull out the liquidity or sell off vested tokens. These products are cross-chain adjusted and deployed on multiple blockchain networks.

BlockPad team who has been working on this innovative startup for the first quarter of 2021, have developed a fully decentralized token vesting solution. It is being used by more than 25 crypto projects because of its intuitive user interface and ability to deploy a vesting schedule without having prior technical knowledge.

It has reportedly gathered over 728 million USD of total value locked (TVL) under the token vesting product that they have deployed on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Avalanche and KuCoin Community Chain (KCC). With the help of its launchpad, Blockius aims to revolutionise the fundraising process on the blockchain.

The current rebranding is specifically made to shift focus to the broader DeFi sector. It efficiently reflects their vision of supporting the DeFi ecosystem as it continues to grow exponentially from a single point as DeFi has contributed more than 200 billion USD in total market capitalization in the crypto space.

As tech giants like Facebook have rebranded to Meta, numerous companies have set their feet to join the technology shift towards Metaverse. Similarly, Blockius will also be offering Initial Metaverse Offering (IMO) along with IDO, IGO and INO to support ingenious projects on blockchains.

Pioneering to solve the inefficiency in the existing crypto market and built on top of the leading blockchains, Blockius seems to have already prepared to witness and serve the next technology revolution towards Web 3.0.

2022-04-20,Is Ethereum Staking Pool Lido’s Growth an Omen of Centralization? - CoinDesk,"“Ultimately you want to stake your ETH and have a derivative that has the most integrations possible, and I think [a centralized staking provider] is never going to get integrated into DeFi,” he explained. “If you stake with Binance and all you can do is have [ETH] locked in Binance – versus getting some stETH [from Lido] and being able to use it on Aave to lever up, or being able to use it to mint DAI on Maker – I just think [Lido] is always going to be a better product.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbS9sYXllcjIvMjAyMi8wNC8yMC9pcy1ldGhlcmV1bS1zdGFraW5nLXBvb2wtbGlkb3MtZ3Jvd3RoLWFuLW9tZW4tb2YtY2VudHJhbGl6YXRpb24v0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tL2xheWVyMi8yMDIyLzA0LzIwL2lzLWV0aGVyZXVtLXN0YWtpbmctcG9vbC1saWRvcy1ncm93dGgtYW4tb21lbi1vZi1jZW50cmFsaXphdGlvbi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-04-16,Did HEGIC fall from grace after Binance delisting - AMBCrypto News,"What happens when Binance decides to de-list a crypto asset? Will the chosen coin or token ever recover, or is the fall from grace enough to doom its prospects forever? We can study exactly this in real-time, as Binance recently delisted Hegic [HEGIC], renBTC [RENBTC], and sUSD [SUSD] on 11 April.

In particular, HEGIC investors began to make some moves to presumably cut their losses.

Mayday, Abort Mission!

Although Binance’s official de-listing notice assured users that HEGIC withdrawals would be supported until 12 July 2022, the metrics captured the change in spirits almost immediately. At press time, the ERC-20 token had a market cap ranking of 899 and was changing hands at 0.01695. This was after falling by 6.25% on the last day alone. At its highest, HEGIC was trading at around $0.50 in February 2021.

Meanwhile, Santiment data revealed that HODLers wasted no time in taking the asset out of exchanges, even as development activity plunged.

👋 $HEGIC was delisted from #Binance on Monday, and metrics showed just how quickly #hodlers moved the asset out of the exchange. Development activity has been low, and prices have fallen ~95% since its previous high seven months ago. Read our analysis! 👀 https://t.co/oilUvvr8yK pic.twitter.com/c9ZfsL0a0y — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 15, 2022

Looking at the charts, one might expect to see a huge uptick in HEGIC coming to the exchanges as investors panic sell. However, the opposite took place as the exchange supply fell almost vertically. This shows how delistings are different from bear runs.

Be careful not to assume that hopeful investors are buying the dip, however. While this is one possibility, note that the HEGIC supply held by top exchange addresses was also plummeting at press time.

This could be due to users quickly evacuating their tokens from Binance.

However, other exchanges such as KuCoin and Uniswap still offered HEGIC trading pairs at press time. So might it be possible to buy the dip? Well, the Adjusted Price DAA Divergence did flash green bars, which many would take to be a sign to buy.

That being said, keep in mind this is probably not a metric that Binance users would want to heed.

Finally, take a look at the astronomical spike in active addresses which happened around the time Binance de-listed the asset. Much of this can be attributed to panic, as new or inexperienced investors likely thought that they had best remove their assets as soon as possible.

All in all, while crypto might be “decentralized” to many traders, the actions of centralized exchanges can deliver a death blow to projects and assets which don’t meet their particular standards.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9kaWQtaGVnaWMtZmFsbC1mcm9tLWdyYWNlLWFmdGVyLWJpbmFuY2UtZGVsaXN0aW5nL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9kaWQtaGVnaWMtZmFsbC1mcm9tLWdyYWNlLWFmdGVyLWJpbmFuY2UtZGVsaXN0aW5nL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-03-06,"Want to Invest in the Future of Crypto? Meet Curve DAO and its CRV ... - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News","The war for one-upmanship has begun in the stable coin market. CurveDAO’s CRV token has apparently emerged as the mega weapon to win the APY war. So, every protocol wants CRV tokens since CRV token holders have been promised a steady return during this bear market.

Those who are holding CRV tokens have been duly getting so much leverage and every protocol wants CRV investors to lock CRV tokens in their own ecosystem. To do that, these protocols are offering unrealistic returns. In this race, Convex Finance has been leading the way with as high as 48% APY, which is 10 times more than what other DeFi lending and borrowing protocols are offering.

If you haven’t staked enough CRV, maybe this is the time to do so because returns as high as this would be once in a blue moon event. But before we go ahead and buy CRV tokens, it is necessary to understand the project. We will help you in this regard.

What is Curve DAO or CRV Token?

CRV Token or Curve DAO Token is a governance token built on top of the Ethereum chain that powers Curve Finance, a DEX, and AMM protocol. Using the Curve DAO DEX, anyone can quickly swap between ERC-20 tokens and avoid impermanent loss. Due to its ability to outdo the impermanent loss that most liquidity providers face while depositing their tokens in specific liquidity pools, Curve DEX is one of the most popular places for swapping and locking crypto assets.

What is Impermanent Loss?

Impermanent loss is the change in the value of the asset from the time of depositing to the time of cashing out or withdrawing. To understand this, let’s take the example of Alice, she deposits 1 ETH and 100 DAI to ETH/DAI liquidity pool. As per this equation, the dollar value of Alice is 200. This means for every ETH, there has to be 200 DAI. Apart from Alice’s contribution, there are 10 ETH and 1000 DAI. The pool total liquidity is 10000.

If the price of ETH increases to 400 DAI for every ETH. Now, Alice wants to withdraw her ETH, but since she holds 10% of the pool. She can just withdraw 0.5 ETH. But that would still be profitable since that would amount to $400. However, had she stuck with the pool, she would have made $500; which is $400 for 1 ETH and the remaining 100 DAI she had. That’s how impermanent loss happens.

Where To Buy CRV Token?

There are many exchanges that offer Curve DAO tokens. However, it is very important to pick a reputable exchange that has strong security measures, good liquidity, and low fees. Here’s a list of recommended exchanges:

How To Buy CRV Token?

There are multiple exchanges where you can buy CRV, but we are showing how to buy it on the Binance exchange. Assuming you already have USDT, we will show you how to swap USDT for CRV.

Step 1

After you have logged into Binance.com, go to trade.

2022-04-26,Hackers Broke Into Bored Ape Yacht Club’s Official Instagram and Made Off With Nearly $3 Million Worth of Stolen NFTs - artnet News,"Hackers have hit the apes once again.

On Monday morning, the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s official Instagram account was hacked and four of the NFTs, as well as other NFTs created by Yuga Labs, were stolen.

“This morning, the official BAYC Instagram account was hacked,” the Bored Ape Yacht Club tweeted yesterday afternoon. “The hacker posted a fraudulent link to a copycat of the BAYC website with a fake Airdrop, where users were prompted to sign a ‘safeTransferFrom’ transaction. This transferred their assets to the scammer’s wallet.”

Some users were duped into believing that if they clicked the link, they would be able to mint a new feature for their NFTs. Instead, it allowed the hacker to access and steal their Ethereum assets.

The digital sleuth known as Zachxbyt examined the addresses that interacted with the phishing site and estimated that about $3 million worth of NFTs were stolen, and the bulk of it—$2.4 million—came from just a handful of rare NFTs.

Zachbxt told Artnet News that the hacker sold the stolen NFTs for a below-value 761.8 ETH ($2.25 million) and transferred the money to accounts with Kucoin and Binance, two large crypto exchanges. In all, some 77 additional NFTs were stolen during the hack, according to ARTnews. BAYC advised owners in subsequent tweets that, upon discovering the hack, it had immediately alerted the community and removed the links to the compromised Instagram account from its platforms. At the time of the hack two-factor authentication was enabled, it said.

Once BAYC regained control of the account, they opened an investigation, with support from Instagram, into how the hacker gained access.

It advised those affected, or anyone who might have information, to reach out by email, and emphasized: “You need to contact us first—anybody contacting you first is not us. We will NOT reach out to anyone over email first, and we will NEVER ask for your seed phrase.”

BAYC did not immediately respond to a direct message seeking comment.

Bored Ape NFTs have been stolen before. In December, New York art dealer Todd Kramer tweeted a desperate plea, saying: “I been hacked. All my apes gone. This just sold please help me.”

Thieves had hacked his digital wallet and made off with at least 15 artworks—including five from the high-profile Bored Ape Yacht Club collection—worth an estimated $2.2 million.

The works were reportedly stolen from Kramer’s “hot wallet,” a tool that is continually connected to the internet, as opposed to the more secure, physical “cold wallet,” which must be plugged in to connect to the web. With the help of community members and online activists, Kramer managed to recover some of the works.

A few weeks ago, a hacker also gained access to the Bored Ape Discord server via a phishing link placed in one of the channels. It resulted in the theft of at least one Bored Ape NFT.

The BAYC team said in a tweet that it had caught the issue immediately but warned users not to mint any NFTs using a Discord link. It also reminded users that it had no plans for any April Fools Day stealth mints.

2022-03-30,Cudos grows globally with highest profile listing to date on Huobi - Cointelegraph,"Cudos, the United Kingdom-based decentralized cloud and computation network, has announced that its token CUDOS will list on Huobi Global, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The CUDOS-Tether (USDT) pair will be tradeable on Huobi on March 30, 2022. This is the token’s highest-profile listing to date.

The Cudos network is a multi-layered blockchain that aims to solve fundamental issues in computation, off-chain data gathering and cloud services. Its native CUDOS token is critical for its ecosystem’s efficient functioning. Utilizing a delegated proof-of-stake consensus model, the token secures the network and allows users to exercise power by voting on governance proposals.

“Over the last year, the Cudos network has grown exponentially, demonstrating the enormous demand for environmentally friendly cloud and computation solutions. Our successful testnet, which attracted thousands of developers, is a testament to our community’s immense support and commitment. The Huobi listing is the latest validation of our efforts toward realizing our goals and underscores our dedication to expanding global access to CUDOS. As a compute network powering blockchain and the cloud by enabling anyone to contribute spare computing capacity, this listing expands our global coverage,” said Matt Hawkins, CEO of the Cudos network.

Empowered by the network’s cost-efficient model, developers will be able to install next-generation smart contracts based on CosmWasm and eventually Ethereum Virtual Machines via Ethermint, benefitting from the robust security guaranteed by blockchain technology. Cudos achieves this enhanced degree of efficiency and security by utilizing a broad community of validators combined with a resilient node design. As a result, network users trust the various enterprise and developer use cases that can deploy on the platform.

Token utility

Tokenholders of CUDOS will gain access to wide-ranging benefits, from staking on the Cudos network to liquidity provisioning on decentralized exchanges, running Cudos validator nodes and testing the network’s computing capabilities. The token’s utility is especially appealing to developers, decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts, organizations and individuals interested in running validator nodes on Cudos.

Growing ecosystem

The rapid growth of the Cudos network in 2021 saw a corresponding expansion of its token accessibility via several high-profile exchange listings. Some of the major exchanges CUDOS is currently tradeable on include KuCoin, Bittrex, Ascendex and Liquid. The expanded access enabled by these listings has contributed to the network’s recent explosive growth, and the Huobi listing marks a significant acceleration of that trend.

Details for the CUDOS Huobi listing

Scheduled listing time: March 30, 2022, at 14:00 UTC

Trading pair: CUDOS-USDT.

2022-04-22,Ethereum's Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory ... - Cryptonews,"Ethereum's Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist

Source: Adobe/Travers

Ethereum’s (ETH) transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), known as The Merge, will likely lead some current bitcoin (BTC) holders to move part of their capital to ETH, one industry insider argues. Others, meanwhile, say that despite a yield on ETH being attractive, regulatory scrutiny means more uncertainty lies ahead for ethereum investors.

Once The Merge has been completed, “users will be able to stake and there won't be any upfront cost,” Kosala Hemachandra, founder and CEO of the popular ETH wallet MyEtherWallet, stressed as the main benefit for ETH investors in a comment to Cryptonews.com.

Hemachandra said that he believes “a lot of bitcoin holders” will move to ethereum in order to be able to stake their tokens and earn a yield on their investment.

The transition of the Ethereum network to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism comes at a time when more and more institutional investors are getting involved in the crypto landscape, with most so far getting exposure only to BTC.

However, with increasing pressure from groups claiming that Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism uses too much energy and is therefore not environmentally friendly, virtue-signaling financial institutions may be getting more interested in Ethereum.

It’s worth noting that no firm timeline for Ethereum’s transition to PoS is known to the public. The best estimates for when The Merge will happen are therefore based on comments from leading developers on the project, pointing to completion in the second half of 2022 or early 2023.

Estimates for when the highly anticipated Ethereum Merge will happen have been pushed back a number of times in the past, and the event was until recently expected to occur sometime between May and June this year.

Despite the unclear timeline, MyEtherWallet’s Hemachandra said he is certain that ETH will become more popular among investors seeking a yield.

“ETH will definitely become more attractive and lucrative as it will be the largest blockchain to offer staking solutions and attractive returns,” Hemachandra said, stating that Bitcoin “will always have a role in the blockchain ecosystem.”

ETH is ‘superior’ from ESG perspective, but preferences could change

Meanwhile, according to Ben Caselin, head of research & strategy at crypto exchange AAX, The Merge could make ETH be seen as “superior” to BTC in the eyes of a certain group of investors “when framed with an ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] perspective.”

However, Caselin added that this narrative could easily change, and said that “institutional preferences could change” as the understanding of Bitcoin and PoW grows.

An important thing to note about ETH’s transition to a yield-generating asset is how regulators will look at it, Caselin said. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already communicated that it is not too keen on yield or interest-bearing products, and this has negatively affected platforms like BlockFi and Celsius (CEL), according to Caselin.

The regulatory uncertainty around ETH’s future could thus scare some potential investors away, and in particular institutions with large amounts of capital to allocate.

As a result of this, bitcoin – as arguably the most decentralized cryptocurrency – could stand to benefit regardless of whether The Merge succeeds or not from a technical standpoint, Caselin said.

“[C]ontinuing to accumulate [BTC] during these years might actually be the best way forward. Because despite what everyone believes – or hopes – bitcoin and the wider crypto markets often defy expectations,” Caselin told Cryptonews.com.

ETH could ""indeed climb to USD 10,000 or above by this year’s end, but it is unlikely to get there without [BTC] at least topping USD 120,000,” Caselin added, while noting that BTC and ETH “still move in relative unison, until one day, they don’t.”

At 14:02 UTC on Friday, BTC was trading at USD 40,293, down almost 6% in a day and up over 1% in a week. ETH dropped over 5% in a day and was almost unchanged in a week, trading at USD 2,993.

2022-04-19,Framework Ventures allocates half of $400M fund to Web3 gaming - Cointelegraph,"Crypto-focused venture firm Framework Ventures has raised $400 million in new funding to invest in early-stage companies across the Web3, blockchain gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) industries.

""FVIII,"" as the fund is called, includes a $200 million allocation to blockchain gaming projects, the company confirmed Tuesday. Framework Ventures, which had early exposure to DeFi, now has over $1.4 billion in assets under management. The company was an early investor in projects such as Chainlink, Aave and The Graph.

Like DeFi in 2020, gaming and Web3 have been identified as the next major growth plays for the blockchain industry. Axie Infinity — a popular play-to-earn (P2E) game constructed around collecting digital pet avatars called Axies — has provided a solid use case for this emerging paradigm. According to blockchain analytics platform Nansen, there are currently 2.8 million unique addresses holding 11.1 million Axies.

Web3 and NFTs stole the show at SXSW 2022, while BTC and cryptocurrency enjoyed very little focus. https://t.co/e38F0Hifon — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 21, 2022

As Cointelegraph reported, Web3 is also fostering the continued growth of the nonfungible token (NFT) market by giving creators the ability to develop NFTs with actual use cases inside virtual ecosystems.

Venture funds and other smart money investors have been keen to back Web3 development companies. On Tuesday, Cointelegraph reported that KuCoin ecosystem companies had launched a $100 million Web3 developer fund focusing on NFT projects. Separately, crypto exchange CoinDCX has raised $135 million to support India-based Web3 projects.

Beyond the blockchain industry, it’s believed that the play-to-earn model could have a significant impact on the future of gaming.

Accelerator will focus on the multi-chain ecosystem and help bridge the gap faced by new interoperability projects in gaining technical and business expertise.

Fund backed by 11 investment partners, including Alameda Research, KuCoin Ventures, OKX Blockdream Ventures, Hashkey Capital, and more.

The accelerator is Ignite’s (formerly Tendermint) third offering aimed at helping blockchain developers.

Tendermint founders were involved with Cosmos, the world’s largest cross-chain ecosystem.

The accelerator also runs Ignite Ventures, launched last year, and Ignite CLI, a solution for developers to seamlessly build interoperable and sovereign blockchains.

Ignite hopes the accelerator will help participating startups with capital and expert resources, including guidance in areas like blockchain development, marketing, and tokenomics, to speed up their development cycle.

2022-04-25,American Bitcoin Miner Aims to Sell USD 30M Equipment in Russia ... - Cryptonews,"American Bitcoin Miner Aims to Sell USD 30M Equipment in Russia to Avoid Sanctions

Source: AdobeStock / amixstudio

US-based Bitcoin (BTC) & crypto mining company Compass Mining aims to sell USD 30m worth of mining gear currently stuck in Siberia to buyers in Russia in a bid to avoid possible sanctions by the US and the EU.

Whit Gibbs, CEO of the Texas-based company, has told Bloomberg that the mining servers have a capacity of 12 megawatts and can't be moved out of the country, adding that the proceeds from the sale will be used to pay off roughly 2,000 customers who own the equipment.

“I understand the sanctions; in this case the punishment is outsized for American miners,” Gibbs reportedly said, noting that while recovering funds is crucial, his clients will have to give up on BTC mining.

Founded in 2020, Compass Mining also operates data centers that host servers owned by their customers. The company benefited significantly from China's Bitcoin miner exodus seen last year, and aims to further expand its business by adding 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts of capacity within two years, Gibbs said.

The move follows a recent decision by the US Treasury to sanction Russian crypto mining firm BitRiver. In a statement, the Treasury justified its decision by saying that it is targeting Russia’s virtual currency mining industry to ensure ""that no asset, no matter how complex, becomes a mechanism for the [Vladimir] Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions.""

However, BitRiver founder and CEO Igor Runets said that the sanctions are an interference by the US in the crypto mining industry in a bid to ""change the global balance of power in favor of American companies.""

Runets added that the company “has never provided services to Russian government institutions and has not worked with customers already targeted by Washington’s sanctions.”

2022-03-29,Aavegotchi's Gotchiverse Looks to the Future While Honoring the ... - Cryptonews,"Aavegotchi’s Gotchiverse Looks to the Future While Honoring the Past, Launches March 31 st

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

Gaming and technological advancement have a well-established symbiotic relationship. At times, the constant innovation and expansion of the industry can be overwhelming, especially for many traditional gamers who still reminisce about hunching over arcade cabinets or jamming controller buttons on the Nintendo 64. In creating the Gotchiverse, however, the developers of Pixelcraft Studios’ Aavegotchi Protocol have crafted an engaging DeFi MMORPG that feels both groundbreaking and familiar.

Aavegotchi protocol is an open-source, community-owned NFT gaming protocol, enabling true asset ownership for gamers. In it, players own Aavegotchis, playable NFT avatars in the form of adorable, pixelated ghosts. These digital pets are staked with interest-bearing aTokens, increasing their value over time. In addition, players can increase the rarity of their Aavegotchi by equipping wearables, playing minigames, and participating in governance as a member of the AavegotchiDAO. Players purchase on-chain assets and reap other rewards by trading GHST, the game’s eco-governance token and base currency.

With the release of the Gotchiverse REALM on March 31 st, players will be able to use their Aavegotchis to interact with and explore a sprawling metaverse that combines sandbox and strategy elements. Players can socialize, join Guilds, participate in mini-games, farm for resources, buy and sell various NFTs, and engage in combat. All the while, gameplay is complemented by an immersive retro aesthetic with bright, 2D visuals reminiscent of 80s video game art.

Two of the three zones that constitute the Gotchiverse, the Citaadel and the Grid, will be available for exploration in the weeks and months following this alpha release. The Citaadel offers stability, protecting Aavegotchis from their enemies, while the Grid will entice those interested in high-risk, high-reward gameplay. Each zone contains interactive landmarks steeped in Gotchiverse lore, and REALM parcels that hold valuable elements called Gotchus Alchemica.

Collecting Gotchus Alchemica is one of the overarching goals of the Gotchiverse. These four elements—FOMO, KEK, ALPHA, and FUD—are ERC-20 tokens distributed among REALM parcels in varying concentrations. They can be freely traded on the Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX), a DEX that supports GHST pairs for each element, or combined to build Installations, important structures that confer perks to a given REALM parcel and can also be traded for GHST.

All Aavegotchis earn a daily stipend of the elements. Those in Guilds can receive additional Alchemica by channeling it together while gathered on a REALM parcel equipped with a Gotchi Lodge Installation. Aavegotchis can also roam the Grid searching for loose Alchemica spills, but they run the risk of bumping into their arch nemeses, the Lickquidators, one-time use NFTs that function as free-to-play entry points into the Gotchiverse. Players can also harvest the tokens from their REALM parcel, which contain either Humble, Reasonable, or Spacious amounts of Alchemica, with the exact amounts determined by Chainlink VRF, a random number generator.

Parcel owners can deploy their Aavegotchis (and borrow others) to farm for Alchemica and build Harvester Installations to passively accrue the materials.

Owning REALM parcels is critical to accumulating Gotchus Alchemica. The 155,069 REALM of the Citaadel and the Grid will be distributed across the next two years (Act 1). The remaining REALM, constituting a third zone called The Beyond, will be released across Acts 2 and 3. Eventually, a total of 420,069 REALM parcels will be made available for purchase. 80% of it will be distributed through a GBM auction, a patent-pending system licensed to Pixelcraft Studios, that allows participants to select and bid on available parcels. Those who do not win have their bids refunded and receive an “incentive” reward of GHST.

The remaining 20% of REALM parcels will be distributed to players through Chainlink VRFpowered Raffles. These Raffles make it possible for players without large amounts of capital to acquire and own REALM parcels by submitting Drop Tickets, ERC-1155 NFTs that can be earned through myriad engagements with the Aavegotchi ecosystem.

Already an ambitious gaming protocol, Aavegotchi represents GameFi at its best. Yet, the flagship metaverse game is impressive for more than its novel take on play-to-earn games; The Gotchiverse infuses complex tokenomics and intricate DeFi infrastructure with the careful world building and rich lore of traditional games like “Clash of Clans” and “Stardew Valley.” As a result, Pixelcraft Studios is poised to establish an entirely new genre of GameFi, one that is exciting and immersive to crypto-hungry NFT gamers and old-school RPG players alike.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hYXZlZ290Y2hpcy1nb3RjaGl2ZXJzZS1sb29rcy1mdXR1cmUtd2hpbGUtaG9ub3JpbmctcGFzdC1sYXVuY2hlcy1tYXJjaC0zMS1zdC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-03-14,"The Metaverse Just Got More Stylish, With Blvck Paris's New NFT - Cryptonews","The Metaverse Just Got More Stylish, With Blvck Paris’s New NFT

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

The lines between the physical world and the Metaverse continue to blur every day because of fresh developments in blockchain technology. From art to fashion, decentralization seems to be the future of most industries. If experts are to be believed, we are yet to see the full potential of decentralization or its effects. Already, countless lives have changed thanks to NFTs and cryptocurrency, a trend many expect will continue. That potential has attracted more players, investors, and developers alike, with each day bringing more innovations than the one before. The Blvck Genesis NFT collection , led by Blvck Paris, is one of the most innovative projects that has made its debut recently.

Blvck Paris is a global lifestyle brand founded in 2017 by French designer Julian O’hayon. It is popular for its “All Black” stylish clothing, accessories, and digital goods. From its visual content to merchandise, Blvck strives to pioneer an inspirational lifestyle, pursuing quality and design. That commitment has seen the brand grow by leaps and bounds, creating a supportive community of millions of social media followers and customers worldwide. The wildly successful brand has also opened physical outlets in locations like Tokyo, Miami, Taipei, Taichung, Hong Kong, and Macau. It has also collaborated with the tech giant, CASETiFY.

The NFT space is another frontier the brand seeks to conquer. A few months ago, the brand introduced three NFT drops on MakersPlace and held an event in Decentraland. Now, it is a brand extending its reach and showcasing its creative design in the Metaverse. Blvck has created and launched an innovative collection that merges its digital and physical designs called the Blvck Genesis NFT collection . The collection features 9,999 unique avatars crafted by O’hayon. These graphical elements boast over 250 high fashion traits covering outfits, tattoos, haircuts, and more.

According to the developer, the project’s long-term goal is to continually unveil innovative ways of bringing the Blvck community together. The Blvck NFT project holders will start enjoying benefits and offers immediately. One benefit will be exclusive access to limited edition physical products and fashion collaborations with other brands and artists. Only members of the exclusive Blvck club will have access to these VIP events which will be held in Blvck stores around the world and the Metaverse as well.

Later, Blvck Genesis NFT will unveil a new play-to-earn Metaverse game in association with Hora Games, the owners of the first-ever NFT gaming platform. The players will use their NFTs as their in-game characters, which will earn them tokens and other products as they play. This innovative collaboration is expected to continue giving the Blvck community members a chance to enjoy more utility. Holders of the Blvck Genesis NFTs will continue enjoying major perks as the project grows. Other expected benefits include access to future NFT collaborations, USD 1 raffles, exclusive merchandise, and more.

Blvck Paris has a track record of success, and this project is not an exception. The Blvck Genesis NFT project is just one in a pipeline full of unique products. The brand plans to launch new NFT projects and continue growing its community. With millions already endorsing it, this is the right place for novices to start their exploration in the Metaverse.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9tZXRhdmVyc2UtanVzdC1nb3QtbW9yZS1zdHlsaXNoLXdpdGgtYmx2Y2stcGFyaXNzLW5ldy1uZnQuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-03-12,Kadena price soars by 40% after new protocol launches and a major exchange listing - Cointelegraph,"In bull and bear markets, the mantra for cryptocurrency projects that are focused on long-term sustainability is “always be building.”

Three reasons for the recent price growth for KDA include a new listing on Binance, the launch of the first decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Kadena network and upcoming roadmap plans which include the launch of an NFT standard and wrapped native tokens.

Kadena lists on Binance

The biggest driver of KDA was the March 11 listing on Binance.

Following the announcement, the 24-hour trading volume spiked from an average of $38 million to $325 million during trading on Friday. KuCoin exchange also saw high trading volume, with $117.4 million worth in trader occurring before the listing went live at Binance.

New projects launch on the Kadena network

A second development helping to boost the price of KDA was the launch of new protocols on the Kadena network including Kaddex, the first decentralized exchange in the project's ecosystem which offers gas-free trading.

Kaddex also announced an integration with Simplex that will bring a fiat onramp into the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

2022-04-14,Newly (Re)released Game Allows Players to Simulate Bitcoin ... - Cryptonews,"Newly (Re)released Game Allows Players to Simulate Bitcoin Mining and Earn BTC

Bitcoin Miner. Source: blog.zebedee.io

The innovative crypto space keeps producing novel ways to merge with different industries and engage more people with cryptoassets, this time crossing the boundaries between gaming, crypto, mining, and earning.

Gaming fintech ZEBEDEE and UK mobile gaming studio Fumb Games have joined forces to release Bitcoin Miner, a game that provides players with real bitcoin (BTC) for running a simulated crypto mining operation.

Paul West, Founder of Fumb Games, said that the latest development marks a second attempt by the developer to introduce players to the concept, but this time, the companies allow users to earn real cryptocurrency for their efforts.

According to ZEBEDEE's blog post:

""The game represents a fusion of tapping to collect coins with methodical strategy as you find the most optimal way to build your mining farm. But the twist is that you get paid real Bitcoin while simulating an activity that would generate new Bitcoin in the real world.""

West said that Bitcoin Miner was originally released some four years ago, “when crypto started taking off,” but that there was “no real appetite for the game” since it was impossible to enable players to earn actual BTC. Now, the game includes this latest functionality.

He added that, “with ZEBEDEE, we were able to put real Bitcoin into the game, which makes the premise of Bitcoin Miner much more fun, impactful and noteworthy for players.”

The blog post instructed that,

""When you see a green satoshi symbol over a coin, you'll earn Bitcoin for tapping it.""

The game also pays out ""a little bit of "" BTC when a user levels up their mining farm.

The fintech's website explains how to withdraw funds from the ZEBEDEE Wallet.

One of the objectives behind the effort is to use the game to promote cryptoassets among gamers. ZEBEDEE’s self-declared mission is “making it easy for gaming studios to put bitcoin into games and revolutionize user-game interaction,” according to the company’s recent tweet.

Simon Cowell, CEO of ZEBEDEE, said that the company hoped that “fun and easily approachable games” like would “foster curiosity” about the world’s number one coin, and that they would get more people “of all ages and backgrounds learning about it and participating in the new digital economy powered by Bitcoin.”

The 'miners' will also need to make a choice if and when to sell their portfolios. When they sell, they get GPUs (graphics processing units) to help their machines get more coins, and if they HODL, they can continue collecting profits and ""mining for new and improved coins.""

To play Bitcoin Miner and other games for free, players will be required to download the ZEBEDEE app which comprises links to various games. The app is also available for download via Google’s Play platform and Apple’s App Store, according to the statement.

Fumb Games’s portfolio includes mobile games such as Merge Monsters, Blacksmith, Zombie Labs, and Mergecraft.

2022-04-20,Snoop Dogg is bringing digital weed to the metaverse - CryptoSlate,"Digital weed farms are coming to Mobland, thanks to a collaboration between Snoop Dogg and popular NFT creator Champ Medici.

In a press release shared with CryptoSlate, Mobland announced that it will launch a limited collection of Snoop Dogg branded digital weed farm NFTs and some exclusive content from Champ Medici as part of the release.

Farm digital weed in Snoop Dogg’s favorite mafia-themed metaverse

Aside from being a hip-hop superstar and a music mogul, Snoop Dogg is also one of the most vocal members of the crypto industry. After building a virtual version of his real-life mansion and holding a virtual concert in The Sandbox, Snoop has switched his focus to Mobland, a popular mafia-themed metaverse regarded as the crypto version of the cult video game Mafia Wars.

Snoop Dogg isn’t the only one involved with the fast-growing metaverse — Mobland boasts support from some of the biggest names in the industry, including Terra co-founder Do Kwon, Twitch co-founder Justin Kan, and Animoca Brands.

Besides being a virtual gathering place, the metaverse enables players to participate in daily events and games, including cross-chain tournaments. The development team behind Mobland has been steadily introducing business features and new uses for land, with the release of digital weed farms being the latest step in that effort.

Snoop Dogg’s digital weed farm NFTs will be used to promote the launch of business buildings in Mobland, which are set to be released later in the quarter. Mobland believes that the introduction of business buildings will revolutionize the existing metaverse design.

“NFT 1.0 is about individual character and item, NFT 2.0 is about land and real estate, NFT 3.0 is about business and utility on top of the land and real estate.”

Mobland co-founder Roy Liu told CryptoSlate. He added that bringing digital cannabis to Mobland will help bring more adoption to the metaverse and GameFi 2.0.

Under the partnership with Snoop Dogg, Mobland will also release exclusive content from Champ Medici, a popular NFT creator.

“I saw my father play video games my whole life. Cannabis and game controllers live hand in hand with him, that’s why I think it’s no brainer to bring the metaverse and digital weed together.

Snoop Dogg said a paradigm shift is happening in the metaverse, and collaborating with Mobland and Champ Medici was his chance to get at the forefront of it.

“If it’s flipping hamburgers at McDonald’s, be the best hamburger flipper in the world. Whatever it is you do you have to master your craft. I have been mastering my craft for decades. My son showed me the importance of collaboration with MOBLAND to introduce the first-ever digital weed farms as NFTs.”

2022-03-29,"Will Smith Meme Token Soars on Launch, but History Shows Such ... - Cryptonews","Will Smith Meme Token Soars on Launch, but History Shows Such Rallies Rarely Last

Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars.

Source: a screenshot, Entertainment Tonight / YouTube

A token known as Will Smith Inu (WSI) began trading on the decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI) yesterday, with buyers rushing in as they attempt to capitalize on the (in)famous event that unfolded during Sunday’s Oscars ceremony. However, similar coins commonly end up on the ever-growing scrap heap.

The launch of the token followed the incident during which Hollywood actor Will Smith slapped his fellow actor and comedian Chris Rock on stage during the show. The slapping happened after Rock had made a joke about actress Jada Pinkett Smith, Smith's wife - specifically about her shaved head. Pinkett Smith has an autoimmune condition called alopecia.

Created by an unknown person or group of people, Will Smith Inu is not associated with Will Smith or the Oscars in any way.

The details on the token project’s website are also scarce, with only a “Will Map” that outlines the project’s next steps created so far. In the “Will 1” stage, a ‘litepaper’ is set to be published, while the “Will 2” stage will see both a team expansion and the launch of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), according to the website.

Source: willsmithinu.io

“Born from the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars,” the token’s website states, while also calling it “the next hottest crypto meme this bull run!”

At press time on Tuesday (12:55 UTC), the Ethereum-based token was up more than 440% since its launch on Uniswap, and is held by 591 unique addresses, according to the token’s contract address.

Worth keeping in mind, however, is that other tokens created in the past that were also inspired by amusing news events had rarely been good investments.

In December last year, a whole range of tokens had been created inspired by a rant against crypto by US Congressman Brad Sherman.

Speaking during a hearing on digital assets in Congress, Sherman said that “Bitcoin could be displaced by ether, which could be displaced by doge, which could be displaced by hamster coin, and then there is cobra coin,” before adding “now, what could mongoose coin do to crypto coin?”

Soon after, token projects with names like Mongoose Coin (GOOSE) and Hamster (HAM) sprung into existence, with many of them soaring in price shortly after launch.

However, the fun did not last long, with the original Mongoose Coin now being worth zero, and Hamster currently down more than 90% from its all-time high.

A similar situation was also seen a month earlier with the launch of the SQUID token, a project inspired by the hugely popular Netflix series Squid Game.

Despite moving up in price initially, many SQUID investors were caught off guard when they realized that the token could not be sold, and developers said they were “depressed” and did “not want to continue running the project.”

In other words, the lesson to be learned is to tread carefully and not randomly jump on the latest crypto creation unless you are fully prepared to take a loss.

Vitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, Bankless / YouTube

The Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has made some USD 5 million worth of crypto donations – in ETH – with half going to the Ukrainian government and the remainder going to a charity that is providing humanitarian aid to Ukrainian citizens.

Per a tweet from the Ukrainian government-run incentive Aid For Ukraine, which was co-established by the Kyiv-based crypto trading platform Kuna, Buterin “donated almost USD 2.5m in ETH two days ago, and didn’t say a word.”

The Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, a key figure in setting up the initiative, also expressed his gratitude, writing:

“I couldn’t be more grateful for every crypto donation to our lifesaving initiative. It really helps to strength our country and protect democratic values. Special thanks to Vitalik Buterin for standing with Ukraine.”

The incentive wrote that Buterin “also donated USD 2.5m to Unchain Fund” – a charity group founded by blockchain activists in support of Ukrainian victims of the conflict.

It also praised the Ethereum community and wrote:

“Thanks for your enormous help, Vitalik, and thank you for creating ethereum.”

In the past, Buterin has also put ETH into the Ukraine DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that was formed by a member of the outspoken Vladimir Putin critics and pop group Pussy Riot. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which has sold non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has pledged that “100%” of its “proceeds go to support Ukrainians suffering” as a result of the conflict.

Buterin, a Russia-born Canadian, once met with Putin, but has come out as a fierce critic of the President’s actions in Ukraine. He has previously accused Putin of committing “a crime against the Ukrainian and Russian people” by launching an invasion. He has also hit back at a Chinese critic on Twitter who had accused him of “treachery.”

Furthermore, he has hit back at individuals on Twitter who have suggested that the plight of other victims of war is currently being neglected in favor of a focus on events in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Buterin’s main ETH wallet currently contains some USD 173,000 worth of the coin, while another of his ether accounts holds some USD 36,000.

Buterin has previously stated that he also holds smaller positions in “non-ethereum-ecosystem tokens” such as bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin (BTC), dogecoin (DOGE), zcash (ZEC), and omisego (OMG).

“This is only the beginning” said Kevin Lehtiniitty, Fortress’ co-founder and CPO, “our roadmap will accelerate fast to include unlimited folders for organizing your NFT’s, options for NFT publishers to upload new private content to a previously minted NFT, new-content wallet alerts for NFT holders, the ability to hold and exchange cryptocurrency, options to open IRA’s, royalty accounts, and other types of custodial accounts, payment applications, and of course support for many more blockchains.”

Hosts can choose whether they want to host these events for free or at a small fee. They can also choose for these events to either be private or public.

For Guests, this means that users can scroll through hosts in their vicinity and look for their ideal meal. Next to searching for a meal, guests can also custom order a meal they want to eat.

Once a guest makes a custom meal order, hosts nearby will get notified and anyone interested can start bidding to accept the order. Based on their costs, ratings and reviews, the guest can select who gets to accept the job, the duo then gets connected in a chat for better connection and understanding of the guest requirements.

All of the transactions are made on the app, and people can use multiple ways of paying. Whether it’s $PIE or USD.

2022-06-22,OSC holds global crypto asset trading platforms accountable | OSC - Ontario Securities Commission,"Successful enforcement actions lead to monetary sanctions, market participation ban

TORONTO – The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today the outcome of two successful enforcement actions against non-compliant crypto asset trading platforms.

A panel of the Capital Markets Tribunal today approved a settlement agreement between the OSC and Bybit Fintech Limited (Bybit), incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, for failing to comply with Ontario securities law.

In a separate decision, a panel of the Capital Markets Tribunal ordered substantial monetary sanctions and a permanent market participation ban against Mek Global Limited, incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles, and PhoenixFin Pte. Ltd., incorporated in Singapore (collectively, KuCoin) for failing to comply with Ontario securities law.

Bybit and KuCoin both operate unregistered crypto asset trading platforms and allowed Ontario investors to trade securities without a prospectus or any exemption from the prospectus requirements.

“Foreign crypto asset trading platforms that want to operate in Ontario must play by the rules or face enforcement action,” said Jeff Kehoe, Director of Enforcement at the OSC. “The outcomes announced today should serve as a clear indication that we refuse to tolerate non-compliance with Ontario securities law.”

The OSC successfully obtained orders permanently banning KuCoin from participating in Ontario’s capital markets and requiring KuCoin to pay an administrative penalty of CAD $2,000,000 and a further $96,550.35 towards the costs of the OSC’s investigation.

Unlike KuCoin, Bybit responded to the OSC’s enforcement action, maintained an open dialogue, provided requested information, and committed to engaging in registration discussions. As part of a settlement agreement, Bybit has disgorged USD $2,468,910 and paid a further CAD $10,000 towards the cost of the OSC’s investigation. Bybit has also given an undertaking to the OSC, which holds the firm accountable for taking steps to bring its operations into compliance. This undertaking represents a legally enforceable commitment by Bybit to the OSC.

In addition, while registration discussions are ongoing, Bybit confirms that it will not accept new accounts for Ontario residents, offer any new products to existing accounts held by Ontario investors, or engage in any marketing and promotional activities targeted at Ontario residents. If registration discussions fail, Bybit confirms that it will wind up its Ontario operations.

For existing Ontario retail investors, Bybit confirms that it will require investors to wind down their positions in certain restricted products, such as contracts that involve leverage, margin, or the extension of credit. Any funds or assets remaining in Ontario retail investor accounts may be used for non-restricted products or withdrawn from the Bybit platform.

On March 29, 2021, the OSC warned crypto asset trading platforms that offer trading in derivatives or securities in Ontario that they must contact the OSC or face enforcement action. The warning included a deadline of April 19, 2021 for such platforms to start registration discussions. Despite this warning, Bybit and KuCoin did not contact the OSC by the deadline and continued operations in Ontario.

The OSC will continue to take action against non-compliant crypto asset trading platforms and are in contact with international securities regulators to exchange information to support enforcement action.

The OSC thanks the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission for their assistance in the Bybit matter, and the Seychelles Financial Services Authority for their assistance in the KuCoin matter.

All crypto asset trading platforms registered in Ontario are listed on the Registered Crypto Asset Trading Platforms page on the OSC’s website.

Investors are encouraged to check the registration of any person or business trying to sell investments or offer investment advice. This can be done by visiting the Check Before You Invest or the Registered Crypto Asset Trading Platforms pages on the OSC website. Investors can also sign up for email notifications when new warnings and alerts are issued and can follow the OSC’s Twitter feed at @OSC_News.

The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at http://www.osc.ca.

2022-06-23,"Canadian Regulator Fines Bybit, KuCoin For Securities Law Violations - Blockworks","key takeaways “Unlike KuCoin, Bybit responded to the OSC’s enforcement action,” the OSC said

KuCoin is barred from operating in Ontario, while Bybit continues to work on registration

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has hit two foreign cryptocurrency exchanges with enforcement actions after finding they failed to comply with securities laws there. KuCoin has been banned from operating in the Ontario province, while Bybit agreed to pay a fine as it works with the authority to register appropriately.

“Bybit and KuCoin both operate unregistered cryptoasset trading platforms and allowed Ontario investors to trade securities without a prospectus or any exemption from the prospectus requirements,” the regulator said in a statement on Wednesday.

KuCoin, based in Seychelles, has been ordered to pay an administrative penalty of about C$2.1 million ($1.6 million), including investigative charges. Meanwhile, Singapore-based Bybit has reached a settlement with the regulator for about $2.5 million.

“Foreign cryptoasset trading platforms that want to operate in Ontario must play by the rules or face enforcement action,” Jeff Kehoe, OSC’s enforcement director, said.

Bybit has agreed to continue working with the OSC to register its platform. In the event that registration talks fail, the exchange will close its operations with Ontario, the regulator said.

“Unlike KuCoin, Bybit responded to the OSC’s enforcement action, maintained an open dialogue, provided requested information, and committed to engaging in registration discussions,” the regulator said.

Existing Bybit retail customers in Ontario will be asked to close their positions in some restricted products involving leverage, margin or the extension of credit. The exchange told Blockworks this week it’s looking to cut employee headcount by removing overlapping functions.

The penalties come a little more than a year after the Canadian regulator warned exchanges operating in Ontario to contact the OSC by April 19, 2021 for registration or face enforcement action.

“Despite this warning, Bybit and KuCoin did not contact the OSC by the deadline and continued operations in Ontario,” the regulator said.

Authorities have been keeping a closing eye on cryptocurrency products as interest grows in the relatively nascent investment space. Earlier this year, crypto lender BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it illegally offered a high-interest yield product.

The rulings could lead to hesitation among North American investors to invest in cryptoassets as a result of the jurisdiction’s harsh regulatory framework, according to Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM Partners.

He thinks the exchanges themselves won’t be too concerned about financial penalties, as they have been operating successfully for years. “Fines are always preferable to complete bans, and sometimes it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” he said.

2022-06-01,KuCoin plugs into Web3 with new decentralized wallet - Cointelegraph,"Cryptocurrency trading platform KuCoin has launched a new decentralized wallet platform as interest in Web3 continues to gather steam.

KuCoin Wallet is now live for users, with the browser-based platform paving the way for a mobile application, which is still in development.

The platform plugs into the KuCoin ecosystem and features cross-blockchain integration. Users will be able to buy, sell, trade and send a variety of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) in addition to other tokens.

The wallet is self-custodial, giving users full control and responsibility over their private keys.

As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to adopt and support decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token (NFT) functionality, KuCoin Wallet's roadmap will include the addition of DeFi, NFT and GameFi services.

KuCoin's proprietary NFT marketplace Windvane powers this functionality at launch, allowing users to trade and view NFTs in the KuCoin Wallet. Windvane unveiled a $100 million “Creators Fund” in April 2022 to help support and encourage early-stage NFT projects to build on the platform.

KuCoin netted $150 million of investment in a pre-series B round in 2022 — with the firm valued at $10 billion. The firm intends to use the proceeds of the latest fundraising round to continue developing Web3, DeFi and NFT services and offerings within its ecosystem. KuCoin Labs and KuCoin Ventures will spearhead these efforts — which have already come to fruition with the launch of KuCoin Wallet.

A number of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers have recently launched non-custodial, multi-blockchain wallets in recent months to keep pace with interest in Web3 functionality.

Leading United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase integrated Web3 functionality with a wallet and browser for a select group of its mobile app clients in May 2022. Trading on NFT marketplaces was a big focus, while token swaps and other DeFi services were made available through exchanges like Uniswap and Opensea.

Robinhood promoted an upcoming non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet in May 2022 with cross-blockchain accessibility, which will also feature NFT storage and access to marketplaces. American brick-and-mortar gaming retailer GameStop followed suit with the launch of its own blockchain wallet, which will also feature NFT functionality.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9rdWNvaW4tcGx1Z3MtaW50by13ZWIzLXdpdGgtbmV3LWRlY2VudHJhbGl6ZWQtd2FsbGV00gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2t1Y29pbi1wbHVncy1pbnRvLXdlYjMtd2l0aC1uZXctZGVjZW50cmFsaXplZC13YWxsZXQvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

New trading pairs will become available on the KuCoin spot market starting June 28, enabling crypto users to make instant conversions between Euros and cryptocurrencies.

By supporting these EUR fiat trading pairs, KuCoin strengthens its presence across the European crypto market, which continues to see strong growth. Lowering the barriers to buying cryptocurrency with fiat currencies is a crucial step in onboarding more traders looking to set up their crypto portfolios.

On March 23, KuCoin launched SEPA Payments to provide the most straightforward fiat-to-crypto exchange experience. Through SEPA transfers, users can deposit EUR to their exchange account for any cryptocurrency-related purchase through the ""Fast Buy"" channel.

KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu commented on the EUR pairs support, “The new EUR spot trading pairs in the fiat-to-crypto service deployed by KuCoin is another major milestone after the addition of BRL a week ago. We hope this will bring excellent convenience to our local users and those who prefer to use euro. It is extremely exciting to add two fiat currencies with spot trading pairs within such a short time, which also reflects the efficient implementation capability of KuCoin's strategic deployment this year. KuCoin strongly believes that providing a secure and stable bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies will bring a better experience to crypto users, which is crucial for crypto mass adoption. In the nearest future, KuCoin plans to support more fiat trading pairs in the spot market thus becoming the best place to explore the crypto world with fiat for global users.”

On June 20, KuCoin added support for the Brazilian Real (BRL), which is now traded against USDT, BTC, and ETH through direct conversions on its spot market.

Advantages of P2P trading

Advertisement

Fiat to crypto: It’s not that other exchanges don’t allow users to buy crypto using fiat currencies, but P2P is the best way for those who want to start trading only once they have a healthy supply of crypto in their wallets. P2P exchanges, though, are designed for those who want to create a treasury for themselves, and exchange fiat for crypto.

No intermediaries: When the exchange itself plays an active role in transactions, which is the case for most non-P2P exchanges, there are high transaction charges involved. No, this isn’t the gas fee for crypto transactions, it’s the cut that the intermediary takes, which can be quite high. These charges are usually lower on P2P crypto exchanges, and usually don’t exceed 1% of the transaction size.

Faster transactions: The elimination of the intermediary also speeds up transactions, since users can transact directly with each other.

No centralized authority: Regulators have made it pretty clear that they would like crypto exchanges to report transactions, cut taxes and more. The same isn’t always true for P2P exchanges, and neither the exchange nor the government, act as central authorities. Transactions are completely decentralized and happen between users.

Added security: A custodian exchange holds all of your crypto holdings for you, and they’re transferred to your wallet only when you cash out. Which means that if an exchange is hacked, you stand to lose your holdings as well.

P2P exchanges, on the other hand, are middlemen and have no control over your holdings. A hacker can steal data off the exchange, but they’ll have to hack your crypto wallet separately if they want to steal your holdings.

Secure transactions: Not only that, transactions are also more secure because the buyers and sellers can choose to remain anonymous and reveal only the most essential details to each other. It also makes it more difficult for P2P exchanges to track their users.

Control over price: On regular exchanges, the price of a cryptocurrency is set by the market. On P2P exchanges, though, you can choose to charge higher or lower than the market price since the exchange has no role in transactions. As long as buyers are willing to buy, you’ll sell your tokens.

Payment methods: Lastly, most exchanges will have a set of defined payment methods, like paying using UPI , NEFT and net banking. If banks withdraw their services from these exchanges, your money is stuck on the exchange, as has happened multiple times in India already.

, NEFT and net banking. If banks withdraw their services from these exchanges, your money is stuck on the exchange, as has happened multiple times in India already. P2P exchanges, on the other hand, allow buyers and sellers to discuss how they want to pay. You can easily transfer the money to the seller using a method both of you are fine with, and get crypto in your wallet in return. You can even choose to pay using gift cards or other balances if you want, as long as the seller is fine with it.

Cryptos

Most of us may have been introduced to crypto and the decentralized internet recently, but the concept actually started long ago. Long ago, peer-to-peer (P2P) software allowed users to download movies, software and much more from each other’s computers. It wasn’t the same decentralized internet that the world is building today, but P2P is where many of us were first introduced to this concept. Which is why P2P crypto trading was one of the first ways to trade in crypto. P2P exchanges like KuCoin were created to make it easier and safer for people to enter the crypto ecosystem. KuCoin expanded its P2P feature recently, providing users newer ways to trade in crypto.Like P2P downloads, P2P trading also depends on the people involved. Unlike most crypto exchanges, where the third party actually holds a custodian wallet that facilitates all the trades, in KuCoin P2P trading, people buy and sell cryptocurrencies from each other. Unlike custodian exchanges or even decentralized exchanges, P2P exchanges are essentially middle-men that allow different people to find each other.On the KuCoin P2P Trade platform, the exchange provides an escrow service, which makes the transactions safer than usual. KuCoin basically holds the money in an account unless the involved parties have confirmed that they have received the crypto or fiat they are supposed to.In simpler terms, once a buyer places the order, KuCoin freezes the requisite crypto in the seller’s account. Once the seller confirms that a payment has been made by the seller, the crypto is then transferred to the buyer. This reduces the chances of fraud and makes the platform safer than others for those looking to get into P2P crypto trading.Now, P2P trading doesn’t necessarily mean that you don’t have to know and understand the crypto industry. However, it is the easiest way to enter the crypto industry. The advantages are many.Despite their advantages though, you shouldn’t trust just any P2P crypto exchange out there. Considerations like longevity, reputation and security are important.A service that is more reputed and has been running for a long time will likely have better and more trusted software. And people don’t trust software that are buggy or don’t have good features, do they now?That’s where platforms like KuCoin come in. The company conducts operations in over 200 countries and has been doing business in the crypto space since 2017. It has over 10 million users already, which shows that a significant number of users already trust the platform.The KuCoin crypto exchange also has three other important features that you should keep in mind when choosing a P2P exchange — security, payment methods and low transaction fees.The platform charges no fees for P2P exchanges, and supports trades of BTC ETH and USDT for more than 20 fiat currencies, which includes USD, NGN,, MYR and RUB.It provides security by allowing only verified and vetted traders to sell crypto through the P2P mode, through both mobile and desktop interfaces.1. The payment needs to be done manually by the buyer. The KuCoin system does not provide the fiat currency deducting service.2. The token you purchase will arrive in your Main account. Please transfer it from the Main account to the Trading account for Spot trading.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvbmV3cy9rdWNvaW4tZXhwYW5kcy1wMnAtZmVhdHVyZS10by1pbXByb3ZlLWludmVzdG9yLXByb3RlY3Rpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTE0OTM2MjYuY21z0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5pbi9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS9uZXdzL2t1Y29pbi1leHBhbmRzLXAycC1mZWF0dXJlLXRvLWltcHJvdmUtaW52ZXN0b3ItcHJvdGVjdGlvbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTE0OTM2MjYuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-05-04,"Sinverse partners with KuCoin, Cashaa to offer metaverse virtual offices - Cointelegraph","Originally known as the Sin City Metaverse, the recently rebranded Sinverse offers business opportunities as a top metaverse project, according to Forbes. Known as the Grand Theft Auto of the blockchain, the multiplayer game lets users build clubs to hang out and venues for online events and compete in underworld activities to win in-game rewards. Additionally, the social gameplay is blended with the ability to purchase and own a piece of virtual land in the metaverse.

Sinverse took ownership one step forward in its business license sale on April 25. The R-rated, open-world game demonstrated the first step for businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs to begin building their global empires in the metaverse. Prior, the sale had been postponed from April 15 due to servers crashing from high demand.

Sinverse also announced a collaboration with the KuCoin exchange on April 25, with a KuCoin office located in the financial district of Sinverse. This has let Sinverse users instantly see new KuCoin listings on its high-rise building and have instant access to the trading platform. Decentralized finance banking institutions have also participated, such as Cashaa, permitting direct access to financial services for gaming communities to purchase nonfungible tokens (NFTs), digital real estate, and land and business licenses.

A foundation built on 3D action

The Sinverse is built around its native 3D action-thriller game. Although fictional, the game was modeled after real-life cities with exorbitant crime rates — setting a violence- and gore-filled backdrop for each player’s journey to becoming the ultimate Kingpin.

Sinverse incorporates 15,000 undeveloped digital real estate land parcels. Players are invited to purchase at least one parcel of land in the city and develop it using SDKs provided in the development arena.

With the team’s success in land development and sales, the platform’s upcoming business license sale further showcases the power of the virtual world. With an NFT license that costs 5,000 Sinverse (SIN), players get the opportunity to build businesses, such as casinos, coffee shops, brothels, gun shops and other underworld locales.

Sinverse’s architecture is a base platform for partners to host projects inside a greater metaverse or omniverse. As a result, brick-and-mortar businesses may consider the benefits of a partnership for scalability.

Setting the stage for rapid growth

Although Sinverse was launched in October 2021, the project already has more than 25,000 tokenholders and recently set a record during a digital land sale that sold four of 17 districts for $3.5 million.

Its achievements have encouraged further backing from Magnus Capital, Maven Capital, Twin Apex Capital, AU21 Capital and a partnership with Vulcan Forged.

Sinverse is ready for the rest of its 2022 goals, including launching a business license profit-sharing platform and listings on centralized exchanges.

What You Need to Know About KuCoin

KuCoin is a global cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Seychelles. The KuCoin exchange was launched in September 2017, though the company was originally co-founded in 2013 by Eric Don, Michael Gan, Jack Zhu, John Lee, Kent Li, Top Lan, and Linda Lin.

As an exchange platform, KuCoin allows users to conduct cryptocurrency transactions securely and efficiently. As mentioned at the very beginning of this post, the exchange currently offers more than 700 digital assets and has more than 10 million users worldwide.

KuCoin is generally considered a secure platform. The network uses the standard encryption protocol to keep user data and data transfers secured. It also utilizes a multi-cluster and multi-layered architectural system to ensure system stability and smooth transactions.

Just like many other cryptocurrency exchanges, KuCoin had suffered a cyber-attack. The hack occurred on 25th September 2020 and the attackers stole about $275 - $285 million worth of digital assets. KuCoin worked with Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm, law enforcement agencies, and other crypto exchanges to recover a majority of the stolen assets and refunded users accordingly. The company also used part of its insurance fund to refund the rest of its users.

Before moving on from this segment, it is important to mention that KuCoin is regarded as one of the best platforms to earn passive income in cryptocurrencies. The exchange and the company offer several products and services, as well as helpful tools for crypto investors. KuCoin Earn is one of its most useful platforms and we will discuss it properly right away.

What is KuCoin Earn?

KuCoin Earn is best described as a one-stop wealth management service platform that can be used by anyone to generate passive income in cryptocurrencies. It is a dedicated platform on KuCoin that allows users to use various financial products to generate income and increase the value of their holdings. KuCoin key features include:

KuCoin Staking

KuCoin Promotions

KuCoin Burning Drop

Polkadot Parachain Auctions

Ethereum 2.0 Staking

Though KuCoin Earn is easily accessed through the KuCoin Website, it is a professional asset management platform with everything a serious investor will need to earn meaningful income in cryptocurrencies. It encompasses several profit-yielding products and services with various options investors will find attractive.

KuCoin Earn is unique in many ways but one of its biggest selling points is its flexibility. Currently, it supports more than 50 digital assets besides KCS, which is the native currency of KuCoin. Users get to invest and earn in their preferred digital asset.

As mentioned earlier, KuCoin Earn supports several products and services, including staking, savings, promotions, Polkadot, ETH 2.0 and more. Best of all, it offers most of these products on flexible and fixed terms. Users can choose flexible terms when they want to have absolute control of when they can redeem their funds or choose fixed terms when they are comfortable with relinquishing liquidity until a specified period. You should know that fixed-term products yield higher than flexible term products.

Different Ways to Earn Money on KuCoin Earn

We’ve already stressed that KuCoin is one of the best platforms for generating passive income in cryptocurrencies. KuCoin Earn embodies the majority of avenues to earn from the platform.

At this point, we will discuss the different primary products on KuCoin Earn, as well as a few other opportunities on the platform. Before we get started make sure you have signed up on KuCoin.

Open KuCoin Account

KuCoin Staking

Staking is the commonest way to earn passive income in cryptocurrencies. It involves locking up a digital asset for a specific period of time in exchange for interest.

KuCoin uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, so staking on the platform is pretty straightforward. Staking on KuCoin is done via KuCoin Earn (formerly Pool-X Kucoin), and staked assets are used to support validators. KuCoin staking rewards come in the form of high annualized yields as well as POL mining income on a daily basis. POL, by the way, is the native token of KuCoin Earn and can be exchanged for other digital assets.

It is also important to state here that users have options when it comes to staking periods. They can choose between flexible and fixed staking periods. Fixed staking periods are available in 21, 30, or 90 day periods. Flexible staking, on the other hand, implies that users can redeem their staked funds anytime.

KuCoin Promotions

Promotions allow KuCoin users and investors to earn higher yields from crypto deposits. Promotions include special investment opportunities offered to a limited number of participants on a first-come-first-served basis.

Promotions on KuCoin Earn also come in fixed and flexible forms. In a fixed promotion, token holders have to lock their tokens for a specified period of time to earn the determined reward. Flexible promotion, on the other hand, allows token holders to subscribe and then redeem at any time.

KuCoin Burning Drop

Burning Drop is a special investment product on KuCoin Earn that lets users lock a designated amount of crypto assets and earn the associated reward at the end of the entire process. It is a fair token distribution platform and users can find a variety of coins that supports Burning Drop on the interface.

BurningDrop is a unique process that supports the distribution of a wide range of blockchain tokens. It has been particularly helpful for such startups as TCP, FCD, HORD, LOCG, XCAD, LNCHX, and many others. It can also be satisfactorily rewarding for participants.

Participate in Polkadot Parachain Auctions on KuCoin

KuCoin Earn serves as a window to participating in Polkadot parachain auctions. The platform allows DOT holders to contribute tokens to support projects on Polkadot. When the supported projects win the auction, the contributors get on-chain rewards. Again, the staked DOT are returned after the lease period.

When individuals participate in the Polkadot Parachain auction through KuCoin Earn, they also earn a share of the exclusive KuCoin reward pool. This special product helps investors earn rewards while supporting Polkadot projects which promote interoperability.

Staking ETH 2.0 on KuCoin

Ethereum is working hard to make its ecosystem more secure, scalable, and sustainable. KuCoin Earn is helping to promote this while giving users the opportunity to get rewarded by participating. ETH 2.0 encompasses several proposed interconnected upgrades, including the bid to move Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.

In terms of rewards, ETH 2.0 is an interesting avenue to earn income. KuCoin issues a token (ETH2) that corresponds to the rights to an ETH 2.0 token. In addition, participants who hold a certain amount of ETH2 on their main account/trading account will earn ETH2 staking and POL mining rewards.

Alternative Ways to Earn on KuCoin

Besides the primary products that yield rewards on KuCoin Earn, there are a few other ways users can make passive income from the KuCoin ecosystem. We’ll summarize these other options as briefly as possible below:

KuCoin Lending

Lending is actually the most popular way to earn money through the KuCoin platform. KuCoin lending is simple and currently supports as many as 90 digital assets. These include popular coins like ETH and SOL, stablecoins like USDT, as well as meme coins like SHIB.

KuCoin lending makes it easy for crypto enthusiasts to lend and borrow easily. Remember, lenders always charge some interest, so you can always earn reasonable income by lending to other crypto users on KuCoin. Lenders can also choose between manual and auto-lend. Both options are great, depending on the needs of lenders and borrowers.

KCS Bonus

KCS bonus is one of the major reasons people are choosing KuCoin ahead of other crypto exchanges. The company rewards holders of KCS (its native token) for their loyalty and support of the exchange. The rewards come in various ways, including discounts and bonuses.

The KCS bonus program allocates as much as 50% of daily trading profits to KCS holders. However, only users who hold up to 6 KCS daily get this reward and rewards are fairly distributed according to sizes of holdings. Users who pay trading fees with KCS are also entitled to a 20% discount.

Using the Helpful Trading Bot

The Trading Bot is not actually a reward program or a financial product that yields income. Rather, it is a tool that can help you earn more from the KuCoin platform. It is a relatively new tool that can help any user trade better and make more profit.

The KuCoin Trading Bot may not be infallible, but it offers four major strategies that can help traders succeed, including:

Spot Grid Trading

Futures Grid Trading

Dollar-Cost Averaging and

Smart Rebalance.

Why Use KuCoin Earn?

From all we've discussed, there are several reasons to use KuCoin Earn. The platform offers several perks that can help any cryptocurrency enthusiast earn money without many risks. The products are numerous and the potentials are huge.

In terms of specific benefits, KuCoin Earn has a lot for users. The Staking function, for instance, yields double rewards. By staking any digital asset, users will earn staking profits as well as POL mining rewards. KuCoin Earn also offers high flexibility on most of its products.

The number of available assets on KuCoin Earn is another big perk. Users can choose any asset of their choice, including BTC, ETH, KCS, USDT, DOGE, and many more.

Wrapping Up

KuCoin is positioning itself to be the number one crypto platform for passive income. The company, which operates one of the top crypto exchanges, is using KuCoin Earn as a dedicated platform to push for this goal. From all indications, it is succeeding even as KuCoin Earn users are multiplying steadily.

For newcomers, KuCoin Earn can be a little intimidating. However, anyone can learn how to benefit from the platform with time. Here, we’ve discussed the most important things you need to know about KuCoin Earn. You can take time to learn more about the available products and tools and how to make the best use of them.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0OTA5L3doYXQtaXMta3Vjb2luLWVhcm4tYW5kLWhvdy1kb2VzLWl0LXdvcmsv0gFQaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTQ5MDkvd2hhdC1pcy1rdWNvaW4tZWFybi1hbmQtaG93LWRvZXMtaXQtd29yay8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-10,Public blockchain KuCoin Community Chain aims to solve high gas fees on Ethereum - Cointelegraph,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is booming. But despite the fact that Ethereum (ETH), arguably, the main accelerator of DeFi, achieved its goal of becoming the world’s most programmable blockchain, its widespread usage has also highlighted the network’s greatest weakness –– scalability. Congestion has become commonplace on the network, resulting in high gas fees, making it impossible for projects to run microtransaction payments on Ethereum.

Recognizing the limitations this presents, the DeFi space has actively sought out alternatives, with a direct correlation seen in the rising adoption of on-chain bridge technology. With this model, transactions on an expensive network like Ethereum could be routed through a cheaper network with a bridge, enabling cheaper transaction costs. The result is that the world might be introduced to a more efficient space with carefully crafted bridging technologies, one where once isolated blockchains are now connected to ensure use cases are not limited by network scalability.

A combined effort between KuCoin and the community built around KCS, their native token, addresses these efforts by creating a high-performance blockchain, KCC.

KuCoin exists as a well-known exchange recognized as an offering for the people. In comparison, the developer community of the KCS ecosystem originated with the KuCoin community and KCS holders. Together, these teams are putting their knowledge into releasing the KCS white paper.

The white paper outlines how high gas fees on Ethereum can be addressed through a larger ecosystem. In this ecosystem, several different projects and platforms, including DeFi, NFTs, games and Web3-related application projects, will be aggregated to increase the number of scenarios for KCS, the native token of KuCoin.

The release of the KCS white paper is also said to align the KuCoin core team, investment institutions, angel investors and other representatives in the community in the establishment of the KCS Management Foundation. These efforts will oversee the research, funding, investment and resource integration of KCS in developing new offerings that help deliver overarching project goals.

Moving to the multichain 3.0 ecosystem

The public blockchain uses the Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism to reduce the block confirmation time. And while costs are addressed through the exchanges adoption of KCS as the on-chain gas fees. The result is that the team can provide community users with faster, more convenient and lower-cost experiences. It is worth noting that PoSA as a consensus algorithm will also improve security and stability.

In contrast to other public blockchains on the market, the KCC chain operates similar to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. The public chain will be fully compatible with both EVM and ERC-20 smart contracts, ensuring migration costs of projects are low. However, when the KCS token is used for gas fees on the chain, costs will be further reduced, while the production of blocks every three seconds will ensure improved transaction confirmation times.

As the KCC blockchain develops, it will gradually move from EVM-compatibility 1.0 to 2.0, giving it utility in a multichain 3.0 ecosystem, with compatibility across different chains and assets. At this point, it will become crucial for the KCC blockchain to further focus efforts on creating infrastructure suitable for large-scale use and development, complete with intra-chain and inter-chain protocols.

At its core, these technological innovations will remain the main driving force behind the blockchain industry. For this reason, the team has pledged that resources will be devoted to supporting developers in early innovative projects while leveraging the KCS fan community and KuCoin exchange ecosystem on KCC. Therefore, the white paper proves that KCC is more than an ordinary chain and is instead a closed-loop ecosystem of technology, products and users as a birthplace for industry growth.

Live on the mainnet

The KCC project was deployed on mainnet in June 2021, becoming the access point to the greater KCC network, further accelerating the inherent value of the KCS token. Within the KCC ecosystem, the KCS token becomes the underlying fuel for the network, with uses being seen in gas fees.

Following the deployment on the KCC mainnet, the team also released the first phase of the grants and the ambassador programs. KCC has since successfully achieved the first phase of the project’s objectives, including the completion of the on-chain ecosystem’s infrastructure like the deployment of a cross-chain bridge on the KCC blockchain, multisignature wallets and GoDAO websites. Today, dozens of projects have been deployed on the ecosystem, with on-chain TVL approaching $70 million and wallet addresses over 300,000.

Now, following the release of the whitepaper, the KCS token is entering its second stage of development to strengthen its collaboration with the KCC blockchain ecosystem and KuCoin. The team believes that these collaborative efforts will continue to drive variety in future value discoveries.

2022-06-20,KuCoin Exchange Leverages New Brazilian Central Bank Policy And Takes The Lead In Supporting BRL Transfers via PIX - Coinpedia Fintech News,"KuCoin – the world’s five-largest cryptocurrency exchange – has announced that it has officially become the first major crypto service provider to support deposits and withdrawals using the Brazilian Real (BRL). The introduction comes shortly after the new policy of the Central Bank of Brazil came into force.

The KuCoin exchange has partnered with Brazilian payment gateway Capitual in the strive to allow local users to make BRL deposits and withdrawals using the government-backed PIX payment system. The move makes KuCoin the first crypto exchange on the market to empower investors from Brazil with such BRL payment channels.

The recent round of regulations introduced by the Central Bank of Brazil imposes deadlines on requirements before local users regarding updates to identity verification processes, namely Know Your Customer (KYC). The new KYC procedure is a requirement for all exchanges intending on using BRL payment service. Platforms and exchanges that fail to abide by the new regulation will be forced to refrain from continuing to support BRL transactions and related services for users from Brazil.

“As crypto going to the mainstream, fiat to crypto service remains the biggest barrier to onboard more adopters. We are proud to be the first exchange to comply with the new PIX regulations and support our Brazilian users to deposit and withdraw BRL normally. We will soon launch more features like fiat trading pairs to help South American investors trade crypto in an easy and compliant way,” as Johnny Lyu, the CEO of KuCoin, commented on the partnership with Capitual.

The KuCoin exchange has been rapidly expanding on the Brazilian market since the beginning of 2022, resulting in significant increases in its local user numbers. The airdrop event, announced recently, is one of the exchange’s latest initiatives aimed at attracting new entrants into the crypto market through bonus giveaways.

KuCoin also recently released the Into The Cryptoverse Report on Brazil, which states that Brazil is becoming one of the fastest-growing markets for cryptocurrency users. The statistics provided in the report indicate that around 34.5 million Brazilians are crypto investors. Such figures correspond to around 26% of the country’s population from 18 to 60 years of age. Other insights provided in the report reveal that 64% of responders are intent on continuing their investments, while 21% are expressing interest in the decentralized industry.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnBlZGlhLm9yZy9uZXdzL2t1Y29pbi1leGNoYW5nZS1sZXZlcmFnZXMtbmV3LWJyYXppbGlhbi1jZW50cmFsLWJhbmstcG9saWN5L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnBlZGlhLm9yZy9uZXdzL2t1Y29pbi1leGNoYW5nZS1sZXZlcmFnZXMtbmV3LWJyYXppbGlhbi1jZW50cmFsLWJhbmstcG9saWN5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-06-27,OSC Issues Orders Against Foreign Crypto Trading Platforms ... - Mondaq News Alerts,"On June 22, 2022, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) released reasons in its first two decisions against operators of foreign-domiciled crypto trading platforms (CTPs) offering services to Ontario residents: In the Matter of Mek Global Limited and PhoenixFin Pte. Ltd. (KuCoin) and In the Matter of ByBit Fintech Limited (ByBit). The ByBit decision approves a settlement agreement. The KuCoin decision is the result of a written hearing which was not defended by KuCoin respondents.

Both CTPs offer high-risk crypto asset investment products to retail investors, such as margin accounts and perpetual futures contracts which provide up to 100x leveraged exposure to underlying crypto assets.

Both decisions impose significant monetary penalties against the respondent CTPs, with approximately C$2.1 million payable in KuCoin and US$2.5 million payable in ByBit. However, the market restrictions imposed against each CTP varied significantly, largely based on the marked differences in their level of cooperation with the regulator: permanent market bans were imposed on KuCoin whereas limited market restrictions were placed on Bybit.

Important Takeaways for CTPs with Ontario Clients

The decisions demonstrate:

a desire on the part of the Ontario Securities Commission to ensure unlicensed CTPs are registered or diligently pursuing registration or will otherwise face potentially serious consequences.

that trading accounts on custodial CTPs ("" Crypto Contracts "") will be regulated as securities, and the new Ontario Capital Markets Tribunal supports this legal characterization

"") will be regulated as securities, and the new Ontario Capital Markets Tribunal supports this legal characterization the dangers for CTPs of not defending a proceeding or failing to cooperate with OSC Staff once a proceeding has been commenced

the imposition of restrictive undertakings on CTPs while they are working towards registration

Facts underlying KuCoin and ByBit Differ

In KuCoin, the respondents (together, KuCoin) never participated in the proceeding and the Panel's findings were based solely on the evidence and arguments submitted by OSC Staff. Kucoin's failure to participate also led to adverse inferences being drawn by the Panel based on no contrary evidence from KuCoin in response to the evidence led by OSC Staff. The Panel imposed a permanent ban of KuCoin from the Ontario capital markets. The Panel also concluded that all spot, margin and derivative products offered on the CTP (the KuCoin Platform) were ""investment contracts"", a head of the definition of securities, based on the test established in Pacific Coast Coin Exchange1.

In contrast, in ByBit , the respondent (ByBit) cooperated extensively with OSC Staff throughout the proceedings, made detailed factual admissions as part of the settlement and expressed a willingness to bring its CTP (the ByBit Platform) into compliance with Ontario securities law. Consequently, while Ontarians cannot currently open new accounts on the ByBit Platform and retail investors can no longer access margin or derivative products, ByBit is permitted to continue offering limited services to its existing clients in Ontario and to pursue registration as a dealer with the OSC. This arrangement is detailed in an undertaking made by ByBit as a condition of its settlement agreement with OSC Staff (the ByBit Undertaking).

The ByBit Undertaking is less restrictive than the undertaking given by Binance Holdings Limited and Binance Capital Markets Inc. (together, Binance) in March 2022 (the Binance Undertaking), which effectively prohibits Binance from offering any services in Ontario while ""pursuing a regulatory path to ensure compliance with Ontario securities law"".

A more detailed discussion of the key elements of KuCoin and ByBit, and their implications for the evolving regulatory framework for CTPs in Canada, is set out below.

KuCoin

Negative Inferences in an Undefended Hearing

The OSC commenced the KuCoin proceeding in June 2021, two months after Staff of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published Staff Notice 21-329 (SN 21-329), affirming their position that securities legislation applies to online platforms that provide custodial services for crypto assets traded by their users. KuCoin had notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to participate but declined to do so.

The Panel found that OSC Staff proved that the respondents, two related corporations domiciled in Seychelles and Singapore, allowed Ontario residents to open accounts on the KuCoin Platform and encouraged Ontarians to engage in high-leverage crypto asset trading strategies using margin and futures. Staff's evidence consisted largely of publicly available, online information such as the KuCoin Platform Terms of Service and Reddit account, as well as the LinkedIn and Twitter profiles of the respondents' founder, Michael Gan. Staff also led evidence based on an investigator witness who opened an account of the KuCoin Platform, and an investor complaint received by the OSC. KuCoin led no evidence and made no submissions.

Maximum Penalties as Deterrence

Absent any defenses being offered by the respondents, the Panel accepted Staff's characterization of the respondents as ""bad actors"" who ""put investors at risk"", engaged in serious, aggravated and recurring violations of securities laws and ""flouting"" securities laws by not recognizing the seriousness of their improprieties. To penalize KuCoin, and as a deterrent for other CTPs, the Panel imposed the maximum penalties possible against KuCoin in the circumstances: a $2 million fine, costs of almost $100,000 and permanent market participation bans.

Broad Application of ""Investment Contract"" Analysis

Considering the range of highly leveraged margin and derivative products available on the KuCoin Platform, it was easy for OSC Staff to prove that the respondents were dealing in securities in Canada without registration. Staff advanced arguments that trading accounts on the KuCoin Platform could be captured under numerous heads of the definition of ""security"" in Section 1(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario) (the Act), including: (e) evidence of indebtedness; (b) evidence of title or interest, or (n) investment contracts. It is well-established under Canadian securities law that margin accounts are regulated as securities under the Act, beginning with the precedential case of Pacific Coast Coin Exchange vs. OSC2(Pacific Coast).

The crypto asset futures available on the KuCoin Platform likely fall under category (p) of the definition of ""security"": a commodity futures contract or option that is not traded on a recognized commodity futures exchange. Crypto futures like fall within the definition of ""derivative"" under the Act, which includes ""an option, swap, futures contract, forward contract..."" Therefore, the Panel could have concluded that KuCoin was dealing in securities and derivatives in Ontario without considering whether KuCoin offered ""Crypto Contracts"", a term developed by CSA Staff in SN 21-329 to describe the relationship between a CTP and its users where clients do not take immediate delivery of the crypto assets purchased by them, and therefore rely on the CTP to satisfy its delivery and custodial obligations.

Since SN 21-329 was published in March 2021, eight Canadian-domiciled CTPs have registered as dealers under securities legislation (Registered CTPs), and have restricted the products available on their platforms to fully-paid crypto assets that are considered appropriate for Canadian retail investors based on criteria developed in collaboratively by CSA Staff and the CTPs in discussions leading up to their registrations. Registered CTPs have accepted that the Crypto Contracts they offer to Canadian investors are considered securities and have obtained exemptive relief from the prospectus requirement to offer such Crypto Contracts to retail investors (the CTP Orders). However, neither SN 21-329 nor the CTP Orders categorize Crypto Contracts as investment contracts or any other specific, enumerated type of security.

Some may find it surprising that the Panel in KuCoin found it necessary to conclude that Crypto Contracts fall within the investment contract category of security, particularly since KuCoin offered margin trading and derivatives, which are regulated under securities laws. Products offered by Registered CTPs differ greatly from those available on the KuCoin Platform, since the terms and conditions of CTP Orders prohibit Registered CTPs from offering margin or derivatives. Nonetheless, the Panel describes ""KuCoin's significant efforts"" for the purpose of the Pacific Coast test as ""KuCoin's actions, custody and solvency to manage and deliver on the Crypto Contracts issued to investors""3.

We expect that Registered CTPs would not consider themselves to be in a ""common enterprise"" with their clients, whose ""expectations of profits"" are based primarily on their expectations that market value of crypto assets traded and held on the platform will increase over time.

While the reasons KuCoin may not have the same precedential weight as reasons following a contested hearing where respondents lead evidence and contest OSC Staff's arguments, we note that an overly broad application of the ""investment contract"" analysis could have unintended consequences for the emerging securities regulatory framework for CTPs in Canada. A conclusion that crypto futures contracts are investment contracts (and therefore securities) is similarly concerning, since it is arguably more appropriate to regulate futures contracts as derivatives than securities, having regard to the disclosure and trade reporting obligations under both regimes.

ByBit

Full Disgorgement Notwithstanding Credit for Cooperation

The OSC commenced an enforcement proceeding against ByBit, a Seychelles corporation, in June 2021, the same month as KuCoin. ByBit engaged with the OSC after the enforcement proceeding was commenced and is taking steps to explore the registration and compliance process, most importantly the ByBit Undertaking described below.

In the Settlement Agreement, ByBit admits to engaging in the business of dealing in securities without registration, and engaging in primary distributions of securities without a prospectus, in breach of Ontario securities law. Notwithstanding ByBit's cooperation with the OSC's investigation, the Panel requires ByBit to disgorge almost US$2.5 million, representing total revenues earned from Ontario accounts up to the date of the settlement agreement, and to pay administrative costs of $10,000.

ByBit Undertaking

In the ByBit Undertaking, ByBit agrees to stop offering margin, rolling spot and derivative products (Restricted Products) to retail clients in Ontario within 90 days of the Settlement Agreement. During the 90 day wind-down period, ByBit undertakes to verify which of its Ontario clients are ""permitted clients"" (e.g. institutional investors and high net worth individuals with at least C$5 million in net financial assets) and to require all clients other than permitted clients to close out all positions in Restricted Products.

ByBit also agrees to stop opening new accounts for Ontario residents while its discussions with the OSC are ongoing, and to identify Ontario residents by the address information they provide at the time on onboarding as well as by monitoring IP addresses of potential investors.

ByBit also agrees to a detailed process for a complete wind-down of its Ontario activities in the event that its registration discussions with the OSC fail, as determined by the OSC and communicated to ByBit. After the wind-down is complete, ByBit undertakes to certify compliance with its enhanced controls for restricting Ontario residents from accessing the ByBit Platform for two years following the wind-down.

Finally, ByBit agrees to donate to the University of Waterloo's Engineering Department all revenues earned from the Ontario accounts from the date of the settlement agreement until the date that ByBit registers under securities laws, or exits Ontario.

No ""Crypto Contract"" Analysis

In ByBit, the Panel does not consider which categories of the definition of security or derivative may apply to the Restricted Products offered on the ByBit Platform. The Decision does not mention the ""Crypto Contract"" concept, and the ByBit Undertaking does not restrict ByBit from providing spot trading and custody services to retail clients in Ontario while registration discussions with the OSC are ongoing.

Future Implications

The KuCoin and ByBit decisions, and the Binance Undertaking, demonstrate that the OSC will enforce securities law against foreign CTPs, including by imposing significant penalties and disgorgement. While the OSC leaves the door open for cooperative CTPs to become regulated as dealers and/or marketplaces, its tolerance for platforms continuing to operate in the province without registration seems to be waning.

In addition, while all CSA members participated in SN 21-329 and the CTP Orders, Ontario is the only jurisdiction to commence enforcement actions against unregistered CTPs such as KuCoin and ByBit. Meanwhile, in the year that has passed since SN 21-329 was published, the number of unregistered CTPs offering services in Canada has proliferated.

Moreover, the types of crypto asset services available to Canadians has diversified beyond the spot, margin and derivative products offered on the KuCoin and ByBit Platforms. Canadian investors can deposit assets to yield-bearing accounts on centralized crypto asset lending platforms, and directly access decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols using software services and non-custodial wallets.

As the number of Registered CTPs increases and their businesses mature, we expect they will continue to work collaboratively with the CSA to expand their scope of permitted activities in a responsible manner. Ideally, Registered CTPs and other stakeholders would have the opportunity to participate in regulatory dialogue through a public comment process to develop a balanced regulatory framework which provides Canadian investors with access to financial innovation, while ensuring investor protection and capital markets integrity.

2022-06-17,"South African Crypto Investors Heavily Rely On Social Media For Industry Information, KuCoin Report Shows | - Bitcoinist","South Africa has positioned itself as a key region for financial innovation. It is a region open to the development of new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain. New findings by KuCoin confirm South African crypto investors primarily turn to social media for news, updates, and information.

South Africa And Crypto

It is remarkable to see how South Africa has kept an open mind toward new ideas and technologies in the finance space. A recent survey by KuCoin, dubbed the Into The Cryptoverse report, confirms that 7.6 million South Africans are crypto investors or have used crypto assets in the past six months. Moreover, two in three respondents expect a cryptocurrency to become finance’s future.

Interestingly, the majority of South Africa’s crypto investors prefer low-risk options. That includes using digital assets to earn stable returns through decentralized finance. However, investors need a reliable source of the latest developments and opportunities in the broader crypto sphere. Social media remains the primary source of knowledge for most South Africans, with a strong focus on influencers and media personalities.

More specifically, 72% of those surveyed rely on social media for decentralized industry news and updates. YouTube (58%) is the main source of crypto information for the surveyed South Africans, well ahead of Facebook (31%) and Twitter (25%). That is not too surprising, as social media has the power to introduce new products and services to a global audience. Moreover, social media helps build crypto communities and establishes broader trust in the industry.

Speaking of establishing trust in the crypto industry, the report confirms investors see crypto as money. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are preferred over banks and other financial institutions, thanks to higher yields outpacing bank interest rates by a significant margin. The potential for financial gain continues to attract more people, as 22% of surveyed people have less than three months of industry experience.

Crypto Is Changing People’s Lives

One contributing factor to the growth of cryptocurrency in South Africa is the continent’s overall low employment rate. It forces people to look for other revenue streams, with crypto investments providing a viable and accessible solution. The Into The Cryptoverse report confirms investors from all age demographics maintain a positive attitude toward cryptocurrencies despite current market conditions.

Moreover, many Africans migrate from other regions to South Africa, as the country offers hope to improve one’s financial and social standing. Twitter influencer Thamsanqa Emmanuel mentions how “many Africans have moved to South Africa in the hopes of getting a better life or being able to put food on the table for their families.”

The findings by KuCoin confirm cryptocurrencies play an increasing role of importance in Africa’s financial climate. It is not just about the monetary aspect but the social status that comes along with becoming a crypto investor. South Africa has an open mind toward financial innovation, creating new opportunities for locals across the different generations.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2JpdGNvaW5pc3QuY29tL3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYW4tY3J5cHRvLWludmVzdG9ycy1oZWF2aWx5LXJlbHktb24tc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLWZvci1pbmR1c3RyeS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1rdWNvaW4tcmVwb3J0LXNob3dzL9IBhAFodHRwczovL2JpdGNvaW5pc3QuY29tL3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYW4tY3J5cHRvLWludmVzdG9ycy1oZWF2aWx5LXJlbHktb24tc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLWZvci1pbmR1c3RyeS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1rdWNvaW4tcmVwb3J0LXNob3dzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-28,How to Use KuCoin Earn – A Step by Step Guide to Subscribing to the Platform's Products - CoinCodex,"KuCoin Earn is one of the best platforms to earn passive income in cryptocurrencies. Formally called POOL X, the platform was created by the KuCoin exchange to allow cryptocurrency users and investors to make the best of their holdings.

KuCoin Earn is relatively easy to use. However, it can be a little intimidating for beginners. Even experienced cryptocurrency traders will need to learn about the various products and how to make the best use of them. Here, we are going to discuss a few things you need to know about KuCoin Earn before delving into the step-by-step guide on how to subscribe to the various products.

What exactly is KuCoin Earn?

KuCoin Earn is a wealth management service platform that allows crypto users to subscribe to financial products that can generate passive income. It was originally created as the Staking Pool of KuCoin exchange but has been upgraded to a dedicated platform that can help anyone improve the value of their crypto holdings.

As hinted earlier, KuCoin Earn offers several earning products, including savings, staking, promotions, Ethereum 2.0 staking and parachain auctions. From all indications, we can expect more products to be added in the future as the cryptocurrency and DeFi space continue to expand.

Another spectacular thing about KuCoin Earn is that it supports a wide range of digital assets. Investors can choose from over 50 digital coins, ranging from mainstream crypto coins to stablecoins to meme coins.

Put Your Crypto to Work with KuCoin Earn

Why use KuCoin Earn?

Obviously, you will want to use KuCoin Earn because of the possibility of earning passive income and increasing the value of your crypto holding. But why should you choose the platform ahead of other income-yielding cryptocurrency platforms? What are the specific advantages it offers?

Here are the three biggest advantages of KuCoin Earn:

Double rewards

The first major benefit KuCoin Earn users get is the opportunity to earn double rewards. Staking profit is the normal reward a crypto user gets in the form of interest for locking his assets for a period of time. KuCoin Earn also offers users POL mining rewards. POL is the native currency of the KuCoin Earn platform and is a crucial component in the ecosystem. It can also be traded on the KuCoin exchange.

Multiple staking choices

We’ve also mentioned this earlier, but there is a need to stress it again. The number of crypto assets supported by Kucoin Earn is highly impressive. While similar platforms restrict users to a handful of digital assets, KuCoin Earn supports about 50 cryptos.

High flexibility

KuCoin Earn also wants to make sure that users have a wide degree of freedom when it comes to staking terms. It offers fixed and flexible terms. Fixed terms also offer staking period options of 21, 30, or 90 days. The flexible term, on the other hand, allows users to stake their assets and redeem them at any given time.

Polkadot - Participate in parachain auction slots on Polkadot and Kusama

ETH 2.0 - Stake ETH on the Ethereum 2.0 network

Burning Drop

Burning Drop is a little different from the other products. It is also not among the options you will see when you filter by “Type”, but it is among the menu options at the middle of the page when you land on the KuCoin Earn Page.

Choose the coin and the amount you intend to stake during the subscription period, input your trading password, and click the ‘Stake’ button.

There are minimum and maximum amounts when it comes to participating or subscribing to the different KuCoin Earn products. You must enter an amount within the specified window to stake your asset and earn the associated reward. Also, it is important to read the terms carefully and understand the rules before proceeding with any of the activities.

Checking the details of your KuCoin Earn activities

You can always check the details of KuCoin Earn subscriptions. The procedures are similar for all the products. After logging in to your KuCoin account, select the “wallet” icon and go to “Financial Account”.

2022-06-23,"Exclusive: KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu on crypto crash impact, which coins will survive, India plans and more - The Financial Express","In an extremely volatile world of cryptos, already crowded by hundreds of exchanges, KuCoin has positioned itself as the number 1 altcoin exchange destination within a few years, with over 700 tradable assets. The exchange is more popular among crypto traders looking for “Hidden Gems” from promising cryptocurrency, NFT, metaverse and Web3 projects.

While the global crypto markets are currently battered by crashes, KuCoin has some ambitious plans for this year and the exchange’s CEO Johnny Lyu is confident that the future holds an “upward market”. In an exclusive interaction with financialexpress.com via email, Johnny shared details of KuCoin’s global and India plans, his views on the future of crypto after current crash and more. Edited Excerpts:

What are your views on the current crypto crash? Where is the cryptocurrency market headed globally?

The impending global economic crisis is definitely impacting the overall situation on the crypto market and is fueling a correction period, which is quite natural for any financial market where periods of stability are combined with periods of price drops and hikes. In the more than 10 years since the appearance of Bitcoin, the market has experienced several rounds of ups and downs. But after each bottom, the crypto market was greeted by a bull market. Therefore, the market downturn is temporary, and the future must hold an upward market.

What has been the impact of crypto crash on KuCoin?

The markets are a double-edged sword. In terms of user sentiment, transaction willingness, etc., a good market is sometimes a booster, which can make our platform actions more effective. However, under the current market situation, the willingness of new users to enter and the trading frequency of some users may be somewhat reduced, but this is all staged.

The upward market must be a boost for the platform but in the downward trend of the market, we will also be investing heavily in departments involved in innovation, especially Web-3.0, metaverse environments, and other digital avenues of opportunity, to build up a more competitive platform and provide comprehensive products and services to the users. Short-term market impact is not enough to affect our long-term plans.

Many experts are claiming that most of the cryptos may vanish in a few years. Which cryptos do you think may survive the test of time?

No matter whether it is in the era of Web-1.0, Web-2.0 or Web-3.0, the laws of the market have always been “the Great will win” and “the survival of the fittest”, and the crypto industry is no exception. There is also a strong possibility that the vast majority of cryptos will disappear in the future. As per the market’s survival code, only projects with a strong consensus foundation, a competitive team, and applications that are just needed, will stand a high chance of surviving.

KuCoin’s plans for India

The Indian crypto market is of great importance to KuCoin. To provide better services for local users, KuCoin recruited Indian specialists and established communities in the country. Two years ago, KuCoin launched a $50 million Support Plan to boost the development of the Indian blockchain industry.

Meanwhile, KuCoin labs launched a $100 million metaverse fund in 2021, and KuCoin Ventures and Windvane (KuCoin NFT marketplace）launched a $100 million Creators Fund to support NFT creators, artists, projects etc. The funds will also seek out potential contributors, practitioners and projects in the Indian market.

What are the initiatives supported by KuCoin in India?

We are actively cooperating with local crypto companies, like Bitbns, and the popular video app – Chingari.

As the COVID-19 pandemic hit India, KuCoin initiated a Special Charity Fund in April 2021 with a Rs 10 million donation to a local NGO to address the challenges encountered by Indian citizens. On May 17, 2021, we partnered with the local crypto bank Cashaa to donate Rs 2 million worth of food and supplies to Indian citizens to help them fight against the outbreak of COVID-19. Wheat, rice, dal, and salt have been distributed to citizens of Jaipur, Delhi, Patna, etc., helping them get through the most difficult time. As one of its charity initiative in India, KuCoin has partnered with Adim Sanskruti, a Pune-based Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), to extend daily supplies distribution to Pune.

If crypto legislation comes into force in India, KuCoin will increase investment in the Indian market to consolidate KuCoin’s brand position and to better serve local traders, and as for setting up an operational center in India, it will be considered as per the request of the crypto bill.

What makes KuCoin different from other exchanges?

Every platform has its own strategies. The industry is still in its infancy and we believe all platforms still have a plenty of room to grow. Instead of focusing on other exchanges, we are more prone to focus on the people with us. That’s why we were given the nickname the “People’s Exchange” by our users.

We are happy with how far we got, and we are concentrating on building our own strength in the long run, like finding more hidden gems and localizing our product offerings in key markets, making KuCoin a platform for all classes of investors.

We provide a wide range of crypto financial tools and services to users of all types, including spot trading, futures trading, margin trading, money management, and mining. We also serve over 18 million people in over 207 countries. KuCoin’s global user base lets it be independent of any particular market, giving it additional stability and liquidity for its users around the world.

One of the key advantages of KuCoin is that it offers more Crypto Gems, and many talented projects are launched online on KuCoin. It also supports over 700 coins and over 1200 trade pairings.

Story behind the creation of KuCoin exchange

Behind KuCoin are two tech geeks who were early blockchain adopters. Having started coding at the age of 8 and founded his first startup at 16, the first one heard about Bitcoin in 2012 from his boss – another founder – who inspired him to start mining. While he tried to sell some BTC on Mt.Gox, he discovered that, what was the world’s largest platform at the time, was difficult for beginners to use.

As the adoption of blockchain continued, they realized that it was reshaping the financial system, building a new system that not only serves the few richest, but everyone in the world – even the uneducated, unemployed and unbanked. By the end of 2013, they wrote down the first code in a cafe. After that, they spent over two months completing the code for a trading system. The initial API documentation of this is still present on GitHub. However, because the whole cryptocurrency market was still in its infancy at the time, they each had their jobs, and they were not yet prepared to start a business, so this matter took a back seat.

After they returned their focus to the crypto industry in 2017, they found it incredible that even though 4 years had passed, the systems and services of the entire cryptocurrency trading market were too far removed from the internet industry. Exchanges often suffered delays and downtimes. The instability in the trading system gave rise to user frustrations and worse user experience. This is when KuCoin was created to bring a better trading experience to the crypto industry and bring blockchain and allow everyone to embrace digital assets.

What is the most difficult struggle the exchange had to overcome and how did it do it?

I think the most significant difficulty for an exchange, or a crypto company, is balancing and allocating the company’s limited resources — whether to invest more in R&D to develop more products or to invest more in marketing and sales to gain a larger market share.

At one point, KuCoin faced this same dilemma. After the crypto industry entered a bearish market in 2018 and the sector slowed down, we faced two choices. One choice was to increase investment in market expansion, the other was to prepare for the long-term strategy by improving the infrastructure and bolstering the team, so as to develop a new system to satisfy more demands of the market. KuCoin ultimately chose the latter. Since then, we have launched KuCoin 2.0, Futures Trading, Margin Trading, KuCoin Earn, and other innovative products. Not only have we made great strides in technology, but we have also assembled a competitive team, and this has laid the foundation for KuCoin to become the best trading platform in the world.

New initiatives planned by KuCoin for 2022

KuCoin experienced rapid expansion in 2021. This also became one of the challenges I encountered as CEO of KuCoin: how can we better serve our users amid our business’s rapid growth?

This year, we will mine more crypto gems, explore and experiment more with social trading, and launch social trading features. Next, we will further expand KuCoin’s decentralized ecosystem and will provide users with more decentralized products, such as our decentralized trading solutions. We will also expand KuCoin’s presence in the decentralized space, especially in the metaverse, Web 3.0, and other essential areas.

How safe are investors’ assets on the KuCoin exchange?

At KuCoin, we’re very much vigilant of security and cyber threats, and we ensure that our exchange is safe for trading. KuCoin allows you to trade with confidence, knowing that your digital assets are safe on the exchange. Micro-withdrawal wallets, industry-level multilayer encryption, and dynamic multi-factor authentication are a few of the levels of protection that we employ.

KuCoin offers 24/7 customer support via live chat and online ticket on its help center. The supporting staff are very responsive and patient. Also, KuCoin has established about 23 local communities in Europe, SEA and other regions, providing users with highly localized service and support.

Does KuCoin follow international regulations?

KuCoin operates in the Seychelles and complies with local laws. We respect all laws and policies in other countries.

What is KuCoin’s NFT initiative? What is different about it as compared to other platforms?

Compared with other NFT Marketplaces, Windvane focuses on the core problems that have not been solved in the current market, including the lack of high-quality projects, high user participation thresholds, poor security, high fees and the difficulty of finding potential projects.

2022-05-02,"X Rush IGO launches on KuCoin in early May, IDO whitelist campaign underway - Cointelegraph","X Rush, a casual play-to-earn racing game deployed on KuCoin Community Chain (KCC), has announced the upcoming launch of its official initial game offering (IGO) on the KuCoin exchange. The IGO will take place in about a week and features the sale of 9,500 X Racer nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

As per the announcement by the X Rush team, the X Racer NFTs are a set of 10,000 profile picture-utility NFTs on KCC — with 500 for whitelisted users — including humans, zombies, apes, aliens and more with different rarities. The art for each X Racer NFT is hand-drawn by the artist who previously worked on projects such as League of Legends, MU: Awakening, True Red Blade and Red Alert Online, among others.

The X Racer NFTs represent unique customized characters in the game, each with an exclusive combination of headwear, glasses, accessories, outfits, a race, a gender and more. Holders of these X Racer NFTs will be rewarded with a number of perks, which include access to NFT holder-exclusive testnet campaigns, a passive income of 50 XOX tokens per day — subsequently halved every 50 days — the ability to display and feature a profile picture NFT as a unique profile picture in the game, the right to generate invitation codes and invite friends to participate in a variety of reward-given campaigns, and more.

Most of the X Racer NFTs shall be sold as mystery boxes at 299 Tether (USDT) worth of KuCoin Token (KCS), while some of the rare NFTs in the collection will be sold via an auction mechanism.

Ahead of the IGO, X Rush is also running an initial decentralized exchange offering (IDO) whitelisting campaign for the launch of its native governance token XOX. The IDO whitelisting campaign begins on May 2 at 10 am UTC and ends on May 10 at 10 am UTC.

The campaign features 200 IDO whitelist spots and three free X Racer NFTs for lucky participants. Participants of the campaign are required to complete social tasks in order to accumulate entries and stand a chance at winning the lucky draw. Ideally, the more entries a participant has, the better his chance of winning.

Produced by Penta Studio, X Rush is designed to provide players with an engaging and interactive racing game experience. Players take on the role of AI residents who are racing and fighting against bugs that are destroying metaverses created by AI residents in the post-apocalyptic world. Players can collect their favorite racers and customize racing cars to compete with other players on the leaderboard.

Currently, the X Rush game is available on both Android and iOS. Players can participate in the IGO and IDO campaigns to be qualified for the upcoming second public beta test and experience the gameplay first-hand to help with providing suggestions to the developers.

The X Rush team plans to add a myriad of features to the game over the course of this year. Some of the more immediate additions that players can expect in the second and third quarters of this year will be the expansion of the metaverse by adding more maps for the players to explore. Players can also expect to see the launch of more game items, in-game events and the in-game social system.

X Rush believes that a strong social system will help retain players in the game and build a prolific community.

“Sometimes you play the game for fun, but sometimes you play it just because you can make friends in the game and socialize in the game,” said J, a representative of X Rush.

In order to strengthen X Rush’s vision of a strong community, the team has planned to launch a multiplayer system and interactive marketplace economy by the fourth quarter of this year. Players will be able to trade freely and exchange assets with one another through the launch of this marketplace.

X Rush also recognizes that the fastest way to build a strong and large community is to have a large number of people be able to play the game. Most NFT and blockchain games these days have a high barrier of entry that prevents the game from becoming popular and discovered. That’s why the X Rush team believes that a free-to-play (F2P) model is a must to ensure the widespread adoption of blockchain and NFT gaming. X Rush incorporates this F2P model by offering new users a free X Car so that they can test out the game mechanics before deciding to invest in the game. This flexibility allows for a higher rate of growth in the community.

X Rush also plans to release its open-world model in the first quarter of 2023. This mode will allow players to create and submit their maps and gears, which, if approved, will become available on the global platform for all players to access and play.

2022-06-20,BSV Global Blockchain Convention sheds light on the growing ... - CoinGeek,"frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>

The Metaverse, NFTs, and Web3 are frequent buzzwords we often hear within the blockchain space. It can be challenging to gauge between hype and utility from an investment standpoint. Similarly, the retail business sector and its customers find such terms equally confusing as brands and businesses move towards this new frontier of digital marketing, development, and consumer connectivity. Both investors and businesses alike need to understand the capabilities of these innovative and emerging markets in a simple and comprehendible way.

Day 1 of the BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai showcased a panel moderated by CNBC Arabia Anchor Hussein Al Sayed. This panel approached the growing interest surrounding Web3 development, NFTs, and blockchain among brands, retail businesses, institutional investors, and general consumers. As time has passed, such areas of technology can no longer be ignored by many industries and forward-thinking companies.

Speakers of the panel consisted of Rami Malouf, partner of SNGLR Group, a team of tech entrepreneurs specializing in strategic advising towards exponential technologies; Phil Runyan, co-founder of NiftyCo, a think tank accelerator bolstering web 3 adoption; Lena Nussbaum, founder and CEO of Yes My Love, a German high-quality fashion label based purely in the online sphere; and Lou Yu, head of KuCoin Labs focusing on investing in innovative companies utilizing metaverse and web 3 applications.

Forward-thinking businesses evolving to web 3

Many retail brands have developed succinct business models focusing on social media interactivity and online store establishment within the traditional web 2 framework.

Nussbaum explains her fashion label Yes My Love relies solely on the digital online space as the store is completely online with no physical outlets. Nussbaum perceives the early interest in metaverse, web3, and NFT adoption as a logical step forward for her digital brand. Nussbaum envisions pop-up shops of her store within metaverse environments, as well as digitally backed clones of physical clothing designs. Simple adoption of timestamped NFT authentication of her brand’s clothing on the blockchain is a big step in her field as Yes My Love’s customer base is traditional consumers with little understanding surrounding gaming or web3 technology.

Runyan, the co-founder of NiftyCo, comes from an industry background in gaming and sees web 3 application in the online gaming sphere as a way for consumers to own digital assets, providing further value and agency to the end-user. This is in stark comparison to today’s status quo in which businesses own the assets consumers have purchased within their platform. A business can easily revoke access or ownership of valuable user assets. Non-custodial, blockchain-based ownership can combat centralized asset control and provide further consumer autonomy over their digital assets.

Malouf, a partner of SNGLR Group, explains that many businesses have approached him during the hype of NFT and metaverse interest over the past few years. Entertainment and retail businesses have steadily approached consultants questioning how these new applications will affect their brand and how they can be used to better engage with their customers. Malouf explains that his clients inquiring about the newly developing industry are forward-looking, likely future-proofing their business models for the next decade ahead.

Similarly, forward-thinking governments such as the government of the UAE are beginning to see the transformative nature of this technology. Such tech can shape how public services are offered to citizens, as well as enable public and private businesses to thrive within the virtual sphere.

“Some governments are trying to be ahead of the curve, in terms of building regulatory sandboxes, to get startups and innovators to grow in a safe way,” Malouf said.

Investor Interest in Metaverse Application

KuCoin Labs was established as a metaverse fund and branch of the popular exchange. In addition, it was one of the first businesses to work with NFT and metaverse projects beginning in 2019. The growth in institutional investment interest has only risen since then, with metaverse platforms and popular NFT collections at the forefront of investment considerations.

Yu, head of KuCoin Labs, explains the long-term vision of courageous startups building towards substantial metaverse projects.

“We have a lot of proof-of-concepts for now. But we still need to dig down to the infrastructures…For example, we are looking at the SDKs for metaverses because a lot of people wouldn’t be able to create everything from scratch. SDKs will facilitate developer work, gaming construction, NFT projects, avatars, and item launching,” states Yu. These tools are paramount to metaverse adoption and investment analysis. Yu says this is where KuCoin Labs will focus its attention in hopes of accompanying some ambitious projects within the next three to five years.

For retail investors, Yu sees current NFT uses such as avatars and art collectibles along with imminent AR/VR metaverse projects as a relevant area to assess when considering the broader web 3 space.

Runyan sees companies that are looking to democratize access to the NFT space through accessibility for all as the future pioneers of the web3 sphere. The current state of web 3 does not yet cater to multiple demographics. Much of it is limited to the select few in the ‘crypto boys club.’

“It is by design, made so that not everybody can ape into it…The more access that we create to this industry, we’ll start to see more consistent numbers coming out. We won’t see these insane swings that make every single project feel like a speculative asset.” Runyan said.

Malouf predicts an array of new business models to arise within metaverse environments. Such models will, in turn, establish a self-sustainable economy within metaverse platforms. This is a longer-term investment consideration that will be easier to assess as we move forward to see developers and businesses building directly on top of the metaverse layer.

“Virtual real estate developers, metaverse architects, companies that provide financial services on the metaverse…Lots of these types of business models that see the metaverse as a new economy is also another kind of layer of how investors could look at the metaverse.” Malouf said.

NFT utility and cross-chain bridging considerations

If one is to ignore the tremendous hype and inflated prices surrounding the sales and resales of NFT art over the past 12 months, we are left with the question of utility surrounding the true functionality of NFTs on an immutable ledger. What real-world application can NFTs be used for? Malouf believes the application of NFTs in the real world is an alternative use case from the art collectible hype we have come to see within the space.

“Imagine real estate title deeds eventually becoming NFTs and real-life real estate transfers happening as easily as you can transfer NFTs,” Malouf said.

However, an important consideration must be evaluated, especially when integrating essential contracts such as real estate deeds into a blockchain. This is the issue of bridging digital assets from one chain to another. We are currently in the infancy stage of cross-chain bridging, with many solutions missing the mark by not directly solving the transition of digital assets or posing security risks to sensitive data. It can be argued that the larger-scale application of NFTs to real-world use cases is hindered by the volatility of multiple existing chains and the lack of bridging solutions. The solution may therefore lie within a capable and powerful chain which can establish real world adoption at a significant scale.

As institutional and retail investors, businesses and consumers become further in tune with this exciting new space, new use cases and opportunities are bound to arise. The fast-growing web 3 sphere calls for further productive discussions like the panel above to adopt positive business solutions, harness investment opportunities, and propel a new frontier in digital asset ownership.

2022-05-10,Crypto CEO Shares the 8 Web3 Marketing Jobs of the Future - Business Insider,"From NFTs to crypto, to DAOs and mixed reality headsets, the race to build the metaverse, an all-encompassing virtual world, is drawing interest from companies and talent of all kinds.

Web3 purists might balk at the idea of brands and ads playing an important role in the metaverse. But the reality is that the presence of established brands' can help validate the space and attract more users, as Spencer Gordon, vice president of digital and draftLine at Anheuser-Busch InBev, told Insider in a webinar in February.

This story is available exclusively to Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2026, 25% of people will spend at least an hour per day in the metaverse, for work, shopping, education, and entertainment.

People with marketing backgrounds are likely to play an important role in shaping people's virtual experiences – even if they might not be working for large corporations, but rather for decentralized autonomous organizations or non-fungible token projects.

Insider spoke with Johnny Lyu, CEO at KuCoin, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, who shared the marketing job titles and responsibilities he foresees being created in the coming years with the advent of Web3. Our interview was conducted ahead of the news on Tuesday that KuCoin had raised a $150 million pre-Series B financing round, which valued the company at $10 billion.

Marketers will have to learn to tell 3D stories

Many well-known brands have launched NFTs in the past year, and Lyu said he foresees a dedicated role growing out of brands' need to maintain a successful NFT strategy. NFT curators will be responsible for helping brands translate their products into NFTs and support their sales and advertising,"" he said.

While some metaverse users might be content with a JPEG as a profile picture, others will want fully built avatars in the virtual world. That's why Lyu envisions avatar creators emerging as a new job title. These will be designers tasked with creating unique and bespoke avatars to suit the virtual personalities of their clientele, he said.

""Later, this component will be partially or completely automated, however, we might still rely on avatar creators for a more elite kind of service,"" he added.

As email lists and newsletters start to be replaced by their visual and audible counterparts, advertising will become more creatively targeted, said Lyu.

""Instead of writing a wordy email to your target market, you could use holograms to show customers how to do something in the metaverse,"" he said, adding that this could be performed by 3D advertising managers – those engaged in creating content, drawing on skills required by both designers and marketers.

Influencer marketing will adapt as well, said Lyu. While he acknowledged that the current technology has its limitations, he believes that in the future the psychological and physical characteristics of virtual idols will be more realistic. Virtual idol managers will help with image-making and community outreach, he said.

But in order to make the overarching vision of an immersive metaverse a reality, experts believe brands will have to draw users in through stories. This is where metaverse storytellers could come in, according to Lyu ""They will create scenarios that enable user interaction within the virtual world, and will also create new products and modes of entertainment — for example, quests or events able to fulfill even the wildest of childhood fantasies,"" he said.

Brands will have to integrate into communities

Web2 companies on platforms like Facebook and Twitter aggregated users around a company-owned social media account. Lyu said that Web3's focus on communities means social media managers could morph into community builders, who will help companies transfer their audience of Web2 followers to Web3 communities.

Public relations executives might find themselves managing the outward-facing image of these online communities, which often take the shape of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations. Lyu said he sees reputation managers as individuals who will help maintain a DAO's trustworthiness, while facilitating collaboration and setting up reward systems for its members.

Some advertising professionals might find themselves fending off unwanted advertisements created by rival brands' 3D advertising managers and metaverse storytellers. ""We might encounter a situation reminiscent of a scene from Blade Runner 2049, where a character in the movie walks in and is overwhelmed by dozens of avatars and holograms offering ads. Therefore, an ad blocking specialist or an ad moderator will also be in demand,"" said Lyu.

The traditional career path might be reimagined completely

Lyu acknowledged that as part of the transition to a more virtual world, the very concept of a profession might be disrupted. He said the emergence of young, anonymous creatives might one day replace career-minded creative professionals who seek to build a reputation for themselves at established companies.

""Perhaps a teenager responsible for a world-class NFT collection will become more popular than Gucci or Prada fashion designers. Because of this, success won't be the product of a long and linear trajectory anymore,"" he said.

But not all crypto executives think new job titles will emerge from the transition to Web3.

Igneus Terrenus, head of communications for crypto exchange Bybit, told Insider via email that the disruption for marketers will likely manifest itself in a job's responsibilities instead.

He said a community manager may be arranging mixed-reality treasure hunts, while a branding lead may be giving fashion advice for metaverse wearables. A social media specialist may instead serve as a bouncer for exclusive virtual events where access is given through NFTs, while a project manager at a DAO-led art collective may be managing dynamites and detonators for an NFT project where a Lamborghini gets blown into pieces.

""Job titles themselves won't necessarily be remarkably different. But the tasks Web3 professionals are called upon to perform will be project-based, dynamic, and manifold,"" said Terrenus.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY3J5cHRvLWNlby04LXdlYjMtbWFya2V0aW5nLWpvYnMtbmZ0LWN1cmF0b3JzLTIwMjItNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-21,KuCoin Pool Becomes 10th Largest Mining Pool in The World - CoinCodex,"According to recent data by BTC.com, the KuCoin Pool has become the 10th largest Bitcoin mining pool in the world. It represents a combined mining power of 4,691.21 petahash per second, trailing closely BTC.com and Luxor.

Launched by leading global crypto trading platform KuCoin Exchange in August of 2021, the KuCoin Pool is a high-performance Proof-of-Work mining pool meant to incentivize the use of renewable energy. Miners who use renewable energy are offered discounts, enhancing the overall profitability of such operations.

The pool provides users with low mining fees along with optimized algorithms for higher mining efficiency. Miners can also select from a range of options to maximize their earnings, as the KuCoin Pool offers several unique mining plans and comprehensive crypto financial service.

The pool continues to attract more miners with its high efficiency and rewards. With the Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) payment method, miners can have their rewards guaranteed. Having more pools to choose from helps decentralize and distribute mining power and makes the Bitcoin network more secure.

As the overall Bitcoin mining hash rate continues to maintain record highs, miners keep searching for the best efficiency and payouts. The KuCoin Pool has a distinctive advantage over the competition on this frontier and helps users set up mining equipment very quickly. Moreover, the pool is accessible through cloud mining, providing various mining plans to the users. Cloud mining doesn't require users to buy hardware, do complicated setups and pay for electricity bills, unlike at-home mining. Instead, they rent it from the pool and earn rewards accordingly.

Bitcoin mining pools ranked by real-time hash rate.

The support provided by recognized crypto trading platforms like KuCoin attracts more interest in Bitcoin cloud mining. Cryptocurrency mining through mining pools is becoming more accessible to a wider range of users globally, as it does not require the purchase of special hardware and paying the running and maintenance costs associated with mining. A major advantage on the falling cryptocurrency market is a combination of rewards accrued in real-time and additional benefits to hedge future volatility risks. Finally, a larger number of mining pools further decentralizes the Bitcoin network, as Satoshi Nakamoto had originally envisioned.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0ODIzL2t1Y29pbi1wb29sLWJlY29tZXMtMTB0aC1sYXJnZXN0LW1pbmluZy1wb29sLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAWFodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDgyMy9rdWNvaW4tcG9vbC1iZWNvbWVzLTEwdGgtbGFyZ2VzdC1taW5pbmctcG9vbC1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-06-24,Tips you need to know about account security on KuCoin - The Siasat Daily,"New Delhi: In a bid to help its users identify different kinds of scams in the world of crypto, leading crypto exchange KuCoin, also known as ‘People’s exchange’, has shared some tips that will also help users to secure their accounts.

According to Johnny Lyu, CEO KuCoin, “in most emerging industries, scams and frauds are quite common as there will be plenty of newcomers while there are few places to learn. This is what is happening to crypto”.

“As the industry is evolving, so are the scams. Presently cloned websites are one of the most common scams. Also, we’ve seen scams like fake ICOs, fake airdrops, exit scams, phishing emails, fake admins and so forth. To deal with it, keep learning and DYOR is essential, especially in crypto where we have new things almost every day. That’s why I always say learning is earning,” Lyu explained.

For major players like KuCoin, “it’s our responsibility to educate the beginners, trying our best to protect them”.

“So, we are constantly posting educational posts, articles and videos on our owned channels, and we are going to launch more investor education programs globally,” Lyu added.

Here are the tips that users need to know about account security on KuCoin

Anti-phishing safety phrase (email/login/withdrawal safety phrase): To prevent situations like phishing emails and phishing sites, KuCoin accounts have an anti-phishing security function. Users can set a security anti-phishing safety phrase (such as a motto, etc.) on their KuCoin account.

When logging into the website or receiving an email, a safety phrase will be displayed in the email from KuCoin or the login window. If the safety phrase is not displayed or incorrect, it means that users are on a phishing site or have received a phishing email and therefore should not proceed any further.

Login IP restriction: Users will be logged out automatically when their login IP changes. With this feature, attackers will not be able to log in to your account with the hacking actions.

Setting up KuCoin login and password in a proper way: The company said that there are two basic rules to set a proper login password — never make a password too easy and set a unique password for the KuCoin account. Usually, it is recommended that your password should contain uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and even special characters to increase the security level of your password.

Please note that to prevent potential attackers from locking users out of their accounts, there is a 24-hour withdrawal limitation once a password change action happens to the KuCoin account.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) is also the priority to protect your KuCoin account and crypto-assets. KuCoin supports two types of 2FA — SMS and Google Authentication.

Set the list of usual withdrawal addresses: In KuCoin, there is a security feature called Address Book which allows users to limit the wallet addresses so that it can be secure and convenient after setting your usual withdrawal addresses.

KuCoin Official Media Verification: To prevent any fraud in the name of KuCoin, the company recommends that users can confirm an official KuCoin contact or domain by entering the telephone number, email, WeChat, Telegram, Skype, Twitter, or website address through the exclusive KuCoin Official Media Verification.

KYC verification: KYC can effectively reduce fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing, among other malicious activities. In KuCoin, the company suggests users complete the KYC verification. For verified accounts, the users can enjoy a higher daily withdrawal limit and participate in the Fiat-Crypto service provided by KuCoin.

Meanwhile, the company said it aims to protect users’ privacy and assets from infringement. Its security team has constantly been improving related mechanisms and performing periodic reviews to protect usersae privacy and assets.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vdGlwcy15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LWFjY291bnQtc2VjdXJpdHktb24ta3Vjb2luLTIzNTYwNzUv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2lhc2F0LmNvbS90aXBzLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtYWNjb3VudC1zZWN1cml0eS1vbi1rdWNvaW4tMjM1NjA3NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-06-01,How To Stake LSS And Earn 38% Rewards - Staking - Altcoin Buzz,"The LSS project (Lossless) has launched a staking program of their native platform token, LSS. It is a promotional activity that was started at 10:00:00 on May 31, 2022 (UTC) on the KuCoin exchange. Users can stake their LSS tokens and earn a reward with an APR of 38%. Apart from this, they are also eligible to get POL mining rewards every day. You can find the product LSS-60D on KuCoin Earn.

The program has gained a huge response from the crypto community, and approx. 3.2M $LSS tokens have been staked within 24 hrs of its launch.

So, in this article, we will explain where you can find the staking program, and how you can participate and grab your share of the profit.

Prerequisites

Below are the prerequisites that users need to satisfy to participate in the LSS staking program:

The program is available on KuCoin. So, you must have an account on KuCoin Exchange. If you are a new user, you can visit the official KuCoin page and create an account first. Users need to hold a sufficient amount of USDT in their KuCoin account to buy at least 200 LSS tokens. (Why USDT, because the LSS token is available in KuCoin with the trading pair USDT.)

We assume that all the participating users satisfy the first criteria. We will now explain from where you can get the LSS token.

Get The LSS Token

If you are not holding the LSS token, then you can get it by going to the below platforms. Check the full list of supported platforms from where you can buy the LSS token here.

Note that you can purchase the token from any of the above supporting platforms. However, to stake, you have to move your LSS token into your KuCoin account.

We have some USDT in our KuCoin Main account that we will use to buy LSS.

Note that to buy any asset, users need to transfer assets from their Main account to the Trading account. They can then perform asset trade, and again after trading, you have to transfer the asset (LSS in this case) back from your Trading Account to the Main Account.

As you can see from the below screenshot, we have bought an LSS token (minimum 200 LSS), enough to become eligible to participate in staking.

Stake LSS

There are two ways using which you can stake the LSS token:

Select the Earn option in Operations- You can simply click on the EARN button appearing on your Main account against the LSS token (see the above screenshot). Via KuCoin Earn- Users can go to the KuCoin Earn option, and find the below- highlighted notification appearing on the homepage.

Select the product LSS-60D. You will see the Subscribe button.

Click on it, and you will get detailed information about the staking program like:

Staking Tenor (the term)

APR

Max and Min Subscription Amount per user

Subscription Period

Staking Period

Accrual Date

Profit Distribution Date

Date of Maturity

Profit Received

POL Fee

If you are satisfied with the staking criteria, then you can enter the amount of LSS token that you wish to deposit.

Confirm the process by clicking on the Subscribe button.

Once the process is successful, you will get a completion message on your screen.

Click on View Details, to know more about your deposit.

The Redeem button is disabled, as already stated by the project. You can subscribe/stake more if you want. Note that each user can stake a max of 50,000 LSS. So, you can stake more until the subscription period is valid and your staked balance is less than 50,000 LSS.

Conclusion

Staking LSS is a lucrative program. You can stake your token for 60 days and earn a 38% reward along with a POL mining reward. The program has certain geographical restrictions (Mainland China users are not eligible to participate). Note that this is not financial advice. We aim to just educate the users with detailed steps so that they can carry out the task hassle-free. Stake only that amount you could afford to lose.

2022-06-03,"Japan Passes Law On Stablecoin To Protect Crypto Investors, Bitcoin Falls - Outlook India","The House Of Councillors, the upper house of Japan’s parliament, The National Diet, on Friday passed a law clarifying the legal status of Stablecoins, surging ahead in an international race to construct safety nets around tokens whose peg to mainstream currencies underpins the broader cryptocurrency market, Financial Times reported.

Following last month’s shocking collapse of TerraUSD, which sparked a debate about whether the tokens should be regulated, banned, or left alone, Japan took action as part of a five-year commitment to protect consumers investing in cryptocurrencies.

Moreover, the bill has essentially defined Stablecoins as digital currencies, imposed a mandatory link with the Japanese Yen, and enshrined the right to redeem them at face value.

In other news, KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency trading platform, has launched its new decentralised product — KuCoin Wallet. Its website has gone live since June 1, but its official App, KuCoin Wallet is expected to launch sometime later in the month, the company has said.

“Open beta app testing is expected to become available in the coming days. The launch of KuCoin Wallet is a significant endeavour for the KuCoin ecosystem in its effort to expand Web 3.0 exploration,” KuCoin said in a statement.

KuCoin has further said that their Wallet is designed to be a secure and easy crypto wallet that supports multi-chain aggregation powered by the KuCoin ecosystem. In addition, it allows users to create a decentralised account for Web 3.0 in seconds, and send, receive, and store BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and more tokens in one place.

KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu says: “As the gateway to the Web 3.0 network, crypto wallets are an important requirement for users to participate in the decentralised ecosystem. It is far more developed than being a mere tool to store digital assets. The launch of the official website of KuCoin Wallet is additional proof that shows the determination of KuCoin to enter the Web 3.0 field at a critical time, with our goals going beyond centralised trading services and entry into the decentralised world to extend its business further.”

That said, another global crypto exchange, Coinbase, which halted payments via unified payments interface (UPI) mode on its app in India in April, on June 3, 2022 announced to pause hirings for as long as the global macro-economic factors remained in place, IANS reported.

The company has also revoked accepted offers from some candidates who haven’t joined it yet.

“After assessing our business priorities, current headcount, and open roles, we have decided to pause hiring for as long as this macro environment requires,” LJ Brock, chief people officer at Coinbase, said in a statement.

2022-06-01,"What Are The Most Innovative Crypto Projects 2022 - Algorand (ALGO), KuCoin (KCS) and RoboApe (RBA) | - Bitcoinist","The cryptocurrency market started from the activities and operations related to a particular token – Bitcoin. Since its launch in 2009, there have been several releases of newer digital assets too. While each of these projects usually promises something different, only a few can keep up with their words. Today, we have numerous failed projects on the crypto market because they were unable to consistently satisfy any utility.

The best crypto projects to buy and hold are those that promise innovation. You see, any project that can evolve regularly will be able to use the latest trends and technology to improve the quality of what it offers. Algorand (ALGO), KuCoin (KCS), and RoboApe (RBA) are some of the most innovative projects in the crypto space. They have gained so much popularity because they have offered one-of-a-kind innovative services to crypto users. Let’s look at essential details about these crypto projects and what makes them special.

The Proof-of-Stake blockchain – Algorand (ALGO)

The Algorand platform is designed with the ability to process multiple transactions in a few seconds. It has a similar design to what you’ll find on popular payment channels, MasterCard or Visa. This blockchain protocol can host other cryptocurrencies and projects, like Ethereum. This token is used to provide collateral security and to process transaction fees for the blockchain.

This blockchain platform was developed in 2017 by a cryptographer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Silvio Micali. Algorand is an innovative open-source blockchain.

2022-06-14,How to Invest in the Walken (WLKN) Token Sale on Bybit Launchpad? - CoinCodex,"Bybit has announced that they will be holding a Launchpad token sale for Walken (WLKN). Users who want to participate in the token sale have to hold at least 50 BitDAO (BIT) or 100 Tether (USDT) on Bybit, and complete an identity verification process with the exchange.

Bybit will be taking hourly snapshots of users’ BIT balances from June 16, 2022 at 00:00 AM UTC until June 20, 2022 at 11:59 PM UTC. Walken will be the 13th project featured on Bybit Launchpad, and they are looking to raise $3.3 million by selling 1% of the total WLKN token supply. The WLKN tokens will be sold at the equivalent of $0.0165 each, but the exact BIT/WLKN exchange rate will be determined at the start of the subscription period.

Walken is a Solana-based game that’s trying to put a new spin on the popular “move-to-earn” model. Walken players can collect characters called CAThletes, and upgrade them by gems earned through walking with the app. Players can use their CAThletes in battles to win WLKN tokens. The CAThletes are represented with non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Before we take a closer look at how you can invest in Walken (WLKN) on Bybit, let’s quickly run through the important dates that participants will have to keep in mind:

Snapshot period: June 16 (00:00 AM UTC) – June 20 (11:59 PM UTC)

Subscription period: June 21 (3:30 AM UTC) – June 21 (10:59 AM UTC)

Distribution period: June 21 (11:00 AM UTC) – June 21 (11:59 AM UTC)

Launch period: June 21 (12:00 PM UTC)

The USDT lottery option - new in Bybit Launchpad 2.0

Bybit has introduced a new twist to its Launchpad platform. Now, users can participate and earn WLKN tokens in two ways - ""Subscription"" or ""Lottery"". The first method remains the same as before – users can subscribe to the WLKN token sale with BIT tokens, and get an allocation that depends on the size of their BIT holdings. Before we show you a step-by-step guide on how to participate through this method, let’s briefly go through the new ""Lottery"" model.

Users who don’t want to hold BIT tokens and use them to subscribe to Launchpad token sales can now participate through a lottery system. The new lottery system gives users the option of committing 100 USDT to obtain a lottery ticket. All the committed USDT tokens are returned back to the user if their ticket isn’t drawn. If the user has a winning ticket, they will receive an allocation of the project’s token (WLKN in this case) and any remaining amount will be credited back to their spot account in USDT. Each user can only obtain one lottery ticket for every project that’s featured on Bybit Launchpool.

For the Walken launch on Bybit Launchpad, 14 million tokens (70% of the total Bybit Launchpad allocation) have been reserved for users that will subscribe with BIT tokens. The remaining 6 million tokens (30%) will be distributed to users participating through the lottery system. Users with a winning lottery ticket will receive 750 WLKN each.

In this guide, we'll be focusing on the BIT subscription method of participating in the launch of Walken on Bybit, as it's a more reliable way of getting an allocation of WLKN tokens.

How to invest in the Walken token sale on Bybit Launchpad?

As mentioned before, the requirements for participating in the Walken token sale on Bybit is holding a sufficient amount of BIT tokens and verifying your Bybit account.

5. Walken token sale timeline

Here's how the timeline for the WLKN token sale on Bybit Launchpad will work, as explained by Bybit:

June 16 (00:00 AM UTC) – June 20 (11:59 PM UTC) – Snapshot period: In this period, Bybit will record users’ BIT balances in their Spot Account, ByFi account and Derivatives Account. Users who have an average of 50 BIT or more over this five-day phase will be eligible to participate in the token sale.

In this period, Bybit will record users’ BIT balances in their Spot Account, ByFi account and Derivatives Account. Users who have an average of 50 BIT or more over this five-day phase will be eligible to participate in the token sale. June 21 (3:30 AM UTC) – June 21 (10:59 AM UTC) – Subscription period: In this period, users are able to commit BIT tokens towards the Walken (WLKN) token sale. After BIT tokens are committed, they will be locked and you will not be able to use them for trading or withdraw them from the exchange.

Please note that once committed, your BIT will be locked and you will not be able to redeem or access any other functions such as transfers, withdrawals or trading until final token distribution.

After selecting the WLKN sale during the Subscription Period, you will be able to see if you are eligible to participate or not. Then, select how many of your BIT tokens you want to commit to the sale.

June 21 (11:00 AM UTC) – June 21 (11:59 AM UTC) – Distribution period: In this period, Bybit will calculate how many WLKN tokens you will receive. This will depend on how many BIT tokens you committed to the token sale, and the total amount of BIT tokens committed by all participants. Once that’s done, the BIT you committed will be deducted from your account, and you will receive the corresponding allocation of WLKN. Since a single user can only buy 20,000 WLKN, any excess BIT tokens will be returned to your Spot Account if the amount of BIT you commit is worth more than 20,000 WLKN.

Conclusion

Hopefully, this article has helped you understand how token sales on Bybit Launchpad work, as well as the requirements you have to meet before you can participate. Launchpad token sales can be a good opportunity to acquire tokens from up-and-coming blockchain projects, but you also have to keep in mind that there are significant risks involved. Purchasing a project’s tokens at a very early stage is inherently risky, and there’s no guarantee that the project will be able to successfully meet their stated goals.

May 31 (Reuters) - If you assumed crypto was just a young person's game, think again.

More people in the United States than ever before are turning to cryptocurrencies to help fund their retirement, it seems, even as the recent market carnage provides a stark reminder that this wild market is not for the faint-hearted.

Some 27% of Americans aged 18-60 - around 50 million people - have owned or traded crypto in the past six months, a poll published last week by crypto exchange KuCoin found.

Yet older folk are more devoted to the young asset class than the general population, according to the survey carried out at the end of March, with 28% of those aged 50 and above betting on crypto as part of their early retirement plans.

Their most popular for investing in crypto were that they saw it as the future of finance, they didn't want to miss a hot trend, and they saw it as a way to diversify their portfolios. (See GRAPHIC)

The market turmoil of recent weeks has hushed talk earlier in 2022 that bitcoin and other crypto would win mainstream acceptance and be ushered into pension plans.

""If they (investors) want crypto, it should be a very small allocation of their portfolio, and they should be prepared to lose it,"" said Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer for multi-asset class strategies at Neuberger Berman.

""We would not recommend it to everybody.""

Indeed bitcoin is trading at around $30,000, down 60% from a peak of $69,000 in November. And the market meltdown means many newcomers' investments are deeply in the red.

Nonetheless, crypto investors and analysts are watching like hawks for any indication that bitcoin could bounce back.

JP Morgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his global strategy team said last week the crypto mayhem had soured investor sentiment so much that certain metrics signalled a ""good entry point for long-term investors.""

Bitcoin funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw the largest outflow since May 2021, JP Morgan said, adding that its position proxy for Chicago Mercantile Exchange bitcoin futures was approaching oversold territory.

Using a model based on the volatility ratio of bitcoin to gold, the team estimate ""fair value"" for bitcoin at $38,000.

$100K OR MORE

The KuCoin poll comes a week after a survey of 11,000 adults by the Fed found that 12% of Americans dabbled in cryptocurrencies as an investment last year.

It did not break down participants by age, but found almost half of those holding crypto for an investment had an annual income of $100,000 or more, while almost a third had an income under $50,000. read more

If older investors are in the new crypto vanguard, though, has there been a rush from asset managers to meet this demand?

Fidelity Investments caused a stir in April when it announced individuals will soon be allowed to allocate part of their retirement savings in bitcoin through their 401(k) investment plans. read more

""Fidelity always operates and makes decisions with the highest level of integrity and an unwavering commitment to our customers, including those saving for retirement,"" a Fidelity spokesperson told Reuters.

But if anecdotal evidence from a Reuters-hosted summit of investors and asset managers in New York last week is any guide, it may have the 401k crypto market to itself for a while yet.

The general consensus was that crypto is prohibitively volatile for retirement purposes. Unless you are a sophisticated investor, such as a hedge fund, or are prepared to swallow a hefty loss, then it is best to steer clear.

2022-05-11,"Crypto Moves — Bitcoin, Ether slightly up; Virtual assets shed $800 ... - Arab News","RIYADH: Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency internationally, traded higher on Wednesday, up 1.34 percent to $31,755 as of 08:20 a.m. Riyadh time.

Ether, the second most traded cryptocurrency, was priced at $2,397, up 1.48 percent, according to data from Coindesk.

Coinbase CEO says new disclosure does not mean firm faces bankruptcy risk

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase said a disclosure in its latest quarterly filing did not indicate the crypto exchange operator faced a bankruptcy risk and it had been made to meet a US Securities and Exchange Commission, known as SEC, requirement.

Armstrong made his comments after Coinbase said on Tuesday that, in the event of bankruptcy, crypto assets held by the exchange could be considered property of the bankruptcy proceedings, and customers could be treated as general unsecured creditors.

The unsecured creditor will be one of the last to be paid in any bankruptcy and last in line for claims.

Coinbase, whose shares plunged 15 percent in extended trade on Tuesday, also missed estimates for first-quarter revenue and posted a loss as turmoil in global markets curbed investor appetite for higher risk assets including cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase reported a 35 percent slump in total revenue to $1.17 billion for the three months ended March 31. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.48 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Coinbase said its disclosure might lead customers to believe that keeping their coins on the platform would be considered more risky, which would in turn materially impact its financial position.

“We have no risk of bankruptcy,” Armstrong tweeted after the disclosure, which he said was made to meet SEC requirements.

“We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn't communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added, my deepest apologies,” Armstrong said.

Bitcoin slumps

Among its mix of crypto assets, Bitcoin accounted for 24 percent of trading volume, up 16 percent from the prior quarter but down 39 percent from a year earlier.

The cryptocurrency market has been roiled by extreme volatility due to economic and geopolitical uncertainties, such as fears of rising inflation and the impact of the Ukraine war, leading to a sharp drop in their prices.

Bitcoin has nearly halved from the record high hit in November last year, as the world’s largest digital asset becomes a major target of governments and regulators looking to crack down on privately operated currencies.

SEC’s Gensler says crypto exchanges trading against clients

Gary Gensler is increasing his criticism of the digital asset exchange, arguing that some platforms are evading rules and may be betting against their customers, Bloomberg reported.

The chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission reiterated on Tuesday that most digital assets fall under his agency's purview and venues trading them should register with the regulator.

The SEC is also ramping up its enforcement efforts, Gensler added.

“Crypto’s got a lot of those challenges, of platforms trading ahead of their customers,” Gensler said. “In fact, they’re trading against their customers often because they’re market-marking against them,” Gensler told Bloomberg News in an interview.

Crypto assets shed $800 billion in market value in a month

Crypto assets bled nearly $800 billion in market value over the past month, touching a low of $1.4 trillion on Tuesday, according to data site CoinMarketCap, as the end of easy monetary policy diminishes appetite for risk assets.

Bitcoin, which makes up for nearly 40 percent of the crypto market, hit a 10-month low earlier on Tuesday, before rebounding to $31,450, just six days after touching $40,000. It was more than 54 percent below its Nov. 10 all-time high of $69,000.

Digital asset prices have slumped, mirroring a plunge in equities on fears of aggressive interest rate hikes across the globe to stave off decades-high inflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 28 percent from its November 2021 record high.

The total crypto market value was at $2.2 trillion on April 2, well off of its all-time peak of $2.9 trillion last November, as per CoinMarketCap.

“Bitcoin remains highly correlated to the broader economic conditions, which suggests the road ahead may unfortunately be a rocky one, at least for the time being,” blockchain data provider Glassnode said in a note.

Signs of weakness in stablecoins, typically a safer crypto currency, further spooked investors. TerraUSD, the world’s fourth-largest stablecoin, lost a third of its value on Tuesday, as it lost its peg to the dollar.

Despite bitcoin’s price slump, funds and products linked to it posted inflows of $45 million last week as investors took advantage of price weakness, according to digital asset manager Coinshares in a report released on Monday.

KuCoin valued at $10 billion in latest funding round

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin raised $150 million in a series B funding round led by Jump Crypto, the company said on Tuesday, giving it a valuation of $10 billion.

KuCoin, the fifth largest crypto exchange according to data firm CoinMarketCap, has 10 million users in 207 countries. It plans to use the money to expand its presence in Web3, a utopian version of the world wide web that is decentralized and based on blockchain technology.

The Seychelles-based company offers trading services and plans to use the funds to expand to crypto wallets, digital finance, NFTs as well as to build its online community of crypto users.

The latest funding round includes investment from Circle Ventures, IDG Capital and Matric Partners.

Private investments in crypto firms have exploded in 2022 despite a slump in Bitcoin and other assets this year.

Venture capital investment in such projects totaled $10 billion globally in the first quarter of 2022, the largest quarterly sum ever, and more than double the level seen in the same period a year ago, according to data from Pitchbook.

Most of the trading volume for cryptocurrencies goes through the exchange across both the spot and futures platforms. With Binance holding the strongest position in the space, it makes sense for most retail traders to use the exchange over others.

Besides offering one of the best trading experiences, Binance continues to innovate their product to put them ahead of its competition.

One of its unique features is the Multi-Asset trading mode on its futures platform, allowing traders to trade USDⓈ-M Futures across multiple margin accounts and enabling users to diversify their stablecoin exposure.

If you are interested in learning what Futures trading is and how the Multi-Asset mode might benefit you, then you are in the right place!

What are Futures?

Futures are financial derivatives products that allow traders to speculate on the future movement of economic assets such as stocks, commodities, or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Traditionally, futures are designed to allow investors to enter into a futures contract and decide a price that they would be happy to buy the asset at in the future. This allows companies to lock in prices for assets such as commodities they intend to buy in the future, providing them a safety mechanism in case prices rise too quickly.

In the cryptocurrency industry, futures are used to speculate on the price of crypto assets using leverage. It provides an option for traders to either long (buy) the market if they think it's going higher or short (sell) the market if they think it will go lower at some point in the future.

Besides the traditional futures contracts, which come with predetermined settlement and expiry dates, Binance also offers “perpetual contracts, "" the most commonly used derivative product on the platform. Perpetual contracts track the spot prices of Bitcoin (or any other crypto asset) and don’t come with any settlement or expiry dates. This allows traders to make leveraged trades on the price of crypto and still retain the ability to exit at any time of their choosing.

Why trade Futures on Binance?

Binance is by far the largest futures trading platform in the industry and usually accounts for more than one-third of the entire industry’s volume. The platform can boast over 200 different perpetual contracts and 20 time-based futures contracts.

Futures on Binance are usually traded against USDT. However, the contracts can be settled in USDT or BUSD through their USDⓈ-M Futures or settled in cryptocurrency through their COIN-M Futures.

The platform offers up to 125x leverage for Bitcoin futures, 100x leverage for Ethereum futures, and between 75x-50x leverage for altcoin futures such as ADA, DOGE, SHIB, and IOTA.

As the biggest exchange in the industry, Binance has accumulated a strong reputation within the market and is often considered one of the safest exchanges to hold your funds. In addition, if things do go wrong, Binance has an insurance fund with over $300 million designed to protect customers.

Additionally, Binance has an industry-leading matching engine capable of executing 100,000 orders per second.

Trade Crypto Futures on Binance

What are the core features of a futures trade?

There are three main features of a futures trade that are essential to understand before trading.

1. Leverage

In typical spot trading, you would need an entire $30,000 (according to current prices) to buy one full Bitcoin. However, with leverage, traders can become extremely capital-efficient and borrow money from the platform to increase their position sizes.

For example, with 10x leverage, you would be able to open a trade with the position size of 1 BTC with just $3,000. You would benefit totally from price movements of the entire BTC, so if it goes up to $40,000 - you would earn $10,000.

However, it is essential to mention that leverage is a two-edged sword that can go against you just as quickly as it can work in your favor. In our example, if BTC would drop to $20,000 - you would experience a $10,000 loss if you haven’t already been liquidated by then.

2. Margin Requirements

All traders are required to have a certain “initial margin” in their account before being able to open a futures trade. This is usually a percentage of the notional value covered by the collateral (USDT or BUSD).

Furthermore, traders also need to have a minimum certain “maintenance margin” in order to keep trading positions open. If the limit on this maintenance margin is met, the position will be liquidated. Therefore, it is essential to have enough margin in the account to prevent unexpected liquidations.

3. Funding Rate

Traders are also expected to cover a “funding rate” with perpetual contracts.

This is designed to ensure that index prices and futures prices stay closely aligned on a regular basis. The funding rates are calculated based on the price difference between the spot and futures market, and traders either pay or receive the funding rate relative to the trade side they are on (long or short).

What is Multi-Assets Mode?

Binance has taken futures trading to another level by introducing its Multi-Assets mode. This feature allows users to trade USDⓈ-M Futures across multiple margin accounts and enables users to diversify their stablecoin exposure.

Before Binance introduced the feature, users were forced to provide margin requirements in one single asset - either USDT or BUSD. This required them to split their funds available between the different collateral options. With Multi-Assets mode activated, users to share their margin across USDT-margined and BUSD-margined contracts.

Now, the profits made on either the BUSD or the USDT contracts can be used as a margin on another contract without splitting the margin between the accounts.

The introduction of the new model is truly game-changing for traders and opens up a range of additional trading strategies such as hedging and arbitrage.

Benefits of using Multi-Assets Mode to trade on Binance Futures

One of the main benefits of using the Multi-Assets mode feature is that traders have the flexibility to open positions in both BUSD-M and USDT-M contracts - without the need to convert between the two assets (BUSD and USDT).

This means that traders can instantly use their USDT to open BUSD-M contacts without having to go through the process of swapping their USDT to BUSD first.

However, the benefits of the Multi-Assets mode go much further beyond making the user experience simpler.

For example, traders now have the opportunity to be able to trade in two different directions on the same underlying market. With the Multi-Assets mode feature enabled, a trader could open a long-term “long” (buy) contract on BTC/BUSD and take advantage of any short-term retracements by going “short” (sell) on the BTC/USDT contract.

In addition to this, the Multi-Asset mode enables traders to hedge against capitulations under one account. If losses in USDT-M BTC/USDT are dragging your portfolio lower, any gains from the BUSD-M ETH/BUSD would automatically be used as a margin to hedge against the losing position. Essentially, this reduces the overall margin requirements for holding any type of losing futures position.

Furthermore, the model also allows traders to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunities. For example, there could be a small price difference between ADA/USDT and ADA/BUSD. Let’s assume that ADA/USDT is at $1 and ADA/BUSD is at $1.01. The difference might be small, but by using large position sizes, a trader would be able to buy ADA from the ADA/USDT contract and then sell it on the ADA/BUSDT contract and turn a small profit.

Advantages of trading BUSD-M Futures with Multi-Assets Mode on Binance Futures

There are a few reasons why trading BUSD-M Futures with Multi-Assets mode on Binance is advantageous.

BUSD-margin Futures are futures contracts that are quoted, collateralized, and settled in BUSD - the stablecoin launched through a partnership between Binance and Paxos. The stablecoin is regulated by the NYDFS and is fully backed by reserves, reducing the potential for any type of stablecoin “de-pegging” disaster that occurred with the Terra ecosystem.

BUSD is issued by a company called Paxos and is fully regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

The usage of BUSD makes it easy for traders to calculate transactions into USD and can act as a barrier against volatility when involving cryptocurrency assets.

Using BUSD-M Futures also allows traders to enjoy lower fees and maker rebates. The discounts apply to any trading pairs that are matched against BUSD, such as BTC/BUSD and BNB/BUSD.

The following table shows the advantages of using BUSD pairs of USDT pairs for a $100,000 trading position.

How to access Multi-Assets Mode on desktop and mobile

To access Multi-Assets modes, you will first need to change the settings in your preferences.

First, head to the Binance Futures platform and hit the settings icon in the top-right corner, where you can place orders. When the menu pops up, hit “Preference”.

This will bring the following menu where we can then select “Asset Mode”.

From here, all we have to do is select “Multi-Assets Mode”.

That’s all there is to it! You will now be trading in Multi-Asset mode, and your margin will be shared across both USDT-M and BUSD-M futures positions.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0OTE1L2EtZGV0YWlsZWQtbG9vay1hdC1tdWx0aS1hc3NldC1mdXR1cmVzLXRyYWRpbmctb24tYmluYW5jZS_SAWFodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDkxNS9hLWRldGFpbGVkLWxvb2stYXQtbXVsdGktYXNzZXQtZnV0dXJlcy10cmFkaW5nLW9uLWJpbmFuY2Uv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-06-24,Explainer: Can crypto holders recoup losses in court? - Reuters.com,"June 24 (Reuters) - A downturn in cryptocurrency prices and crash of one stablecoin has led some investors to try to recover their losses in U.S. court. Here is how cryptocurrency litigation has fared so far and the challenges investors may face.

WHO IS BEING SUED?

Companies that created cryptocurrencies, exchanges that facilitated their sale, and individuals who promoted them have all been sued.

Kyle Roche, who represents cryptocurrency holders in several lawsuits, said U.S. claims over cryptocurrency often involve alleged violations of federal securities or commodities laws, which prohibit fraud and manipulation and require products and operators to be registered with U.S. authorities.

The latest lawsuit took aim at Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra USD, over the stablecoin's recent collapse.

A crytocurrency investor sued the Seoul-based company and its Chief Executive Do Kwon on June 17, alleging they failed to register the company's digital assets as securities and worked with several venture capital funds that backed Terra USD to defraud investors.

A Terraform Labs spokesperson called the claims meritless.

Tether, which is behind the world's largest stablecoin, has been accused of rigging cryptocurrency markets in a lawsuit in New York. And Ripple, whose founders created the token XRP, has been hit with a lawsuit in California, claiming it sold unregistered securities.

Both lawsuits have survived motions to dismiss.

A spokesperson said Ripple disputes the allegations and will defend against them. Tether did not respond to a request for comment.

Cryptocurrency exchanges have been another target for investors seeking to recoup losses.

Binance U.S. was sued on June 13 by investors claiming it falsely marketed TerraUSD as a safe asset ahead of its collapse. And in March, investors accused Coinbase of selling 79 digital assets as unregistered securities. read more

Binance and Coinbase have denied the allegations.

Investors are also suing celebrities who have publicly touted cryptocurrency. A lawsuit filed in Los Angeles claims Reality TV star Kim Kardashian and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. engaged in a cryptocurrency pump and dump. Representatives for Kardashian and Mayweather did not respond to requests for comment. read more

LEGAL HURDLES

A wave of lawsuits brought in 2020 against exchanges alleging they fueled an illegal boom in digital coins largely failed after judges found some of the claims were filed too late or had too little connection to the United States.

Timing should not be an issue for newer lawsuits, but cryptocurrency holders seeking to sue overseas companies in U.S. court could still face hurdles.

Token holders won a default judgment in New York against Singapore-based exchange KuCoin, but dropped the case after a Singaporean court would not make the company provide information to enforce the judgment.

KuCoin did not respond to a request for comment.

Another potential hurdle for investors filing claims under securities or commodities laws will be showing their tokens meet the legal definition of those assets. Some courts have ruled that certain cryptocurrencies fit the bill, but the issue remains unsettled.

Cryptocurrency holders may face additional obstacles when going after exchanges. In the Coinbase lawsuit, the exchange has argued that it was not a party to the transactions, and that private litigants cannot enforce registration requirements.

HAVE ANY CRYPTO HOLDERS WON MONEY IN COURT?

While many cryptocurrency lawsuits are pending, the SEC has reclaimed some funds for investors in a handful of digital assets through settlements.

But even after a settlement, investors may face long waits and still end up with less than they shelled out.

Last year, blockchain company Block.one agreed to pay $27.5 million to settle token holders' lawsuit alleging it had violated securities law.

More than 100 token holders filed claims worth more than $75.7 million, according to court filings. The settlement has not yet received final approval.

2022-05-31,Chain (XCN) ignores the wider market downtrend by rallying 100%+ over the past month - Cointelegraph,"May was an incredibly challenging month for the cryptocurrency market as the majority of tokens booked heavy losses as a bear market was confirmed, but not every project dropped back to pre-bull market lows.

Chain (XCN), a protocol designed to help organizations launch their own blockchain network or connect with other more established networks, has managed to rally more than 120% since May 19.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that since hitting a low of $0.0712 on May 11, XCN has reversed course to hit a record-high at $0.176 on May 31.

XCN/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The three reasons for the strong showing from XCN are multiple exchange listings, launching on BNB Chain and several notable partnerships, including a long-standing collaboration with the Stellar Foundation.

Exchange listings pump up the volume

In March 2022, Chain deployed a new smart contract for its token and rebranded from CHN to XCN. Following the rebrand, XCN listed on KuCoin and subsequent listings on Huobi, Gate.io, Bitrue and Hotbit were accompanied by sharp upticks in trading volume.

Several of the supporting exchanges have also launched perpetual contracts for the XCN token, including Gate.io, Huobi, Bybit and Poloniex, which has helped generate increased awareness for the project and initially led to a spike in trading volume.

XCN is also part of a cross-chain integration with BNB Chain, which enables inexpensive token transfers and trading on PancakeSwap, where holders can earn yield for providing liquidity to the exchange.

Following the integration with BNB Chain, the price of XCN rallied from $0.0712 on May 11 to $0.14 over the next week.

Notable partnerships

Since 2014, Chain has had several notable partnerships and funding rounds, including an initial fundraise of over $40 million from Khosla Ventures, Pantera Capital, Capital One, Citigroup, Fiserv, Nasdaq, Orange and Visa.

In 2018, the project was acquired and became part of the commercial arm of the Stellar Foundation known as Interstellar. Chain was reacquired in 2020 as part of a ledger-as-a-service platform called Sequence.

It’s possible the recent developments with the Stellar protocol, including its partnership with MoneyGram to create a stablecoin-based platform for money transfers, could have positive effects on the price of XCN due to their close ties.

In April 2022, Chain also announced a strategic partnership with Alameda Research, which established the private equity and quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm as Chain’s primary market maker. While none of these partnerships appears significant enough to explain XCN’s current gains, it is notable that the altcoin’s price action has diverged from the wider crypto market for nearly an entire month.

2022-05-03,Developers Raise Over $300 Million With NFTs - Virtual Land Sale for Otherside Drives Up Ethereum Gas Prices - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

The sale of Otherdeeds NFTs, which will allow users to claim virtual land in the Otherside metaverse, brought in more than $300 million

The project is headed by Yuga Labs, the team behind Bored Ape Yacht Club

The massive demand for the sale resulted in extremely high gas prices on Ethereum, and Yuga Labs says ""it seems abundantly clear"" that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain

Bored Ape Yacht Club creators strike gold with Otherside virtual land sale

Otherside, a metaverse project by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) creators Yuga Labs, sold out 55,000 virtual land NFTs in the space of three hours. The NFTs, which are called Otherdeeds, will make it possible for their owners to claim virtual land in the Otherside metaverse.

Currently, details about the Otherside metaverse are scarce. According to the project’s website, the virtual world will incorporate mechanics from both MMORPGs and “web3-enabled virtual worlds”. The virtual world will leverage technology provided by Improbable, a company specialized in software solutions for virtual worlds and metaverses. Per the website, this will allow Otherside to support more than 10,000 concurrent players in a single virtual place, and incorporate physics and AI capabilities into the game.

The currency accepted in the NFT sale was ApeCoin (APE), a token that was launched in March. The token grants governance access in the ApeCoin DAO, and it’s being adopted by Yuga Labs as the currency of choice for their projects. The price to mint an Otherdeeds NFT was 305 APE, which translated to around $5,800 when minting was open. Minting the NFTs was only available for users who completed a know your customer (KYC) check.

Demand for the sale resulted drove up gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain

The overwhelming demand for the NFT sale resulted in a massive gas price spike, temporarily making the Ethereum network extremely expensive to use. According to data from Etherscan, the average gas price on May 1 was 474.5 Gwei, compared to 52.5 Gwei on April 30 and 72 Gwei on May 2. In addition to spending around $317 million worth of ApeCoin to pay for the Otherdeed NFTs, buyers spent $180 million ETH in total on transaction fees. A number of users also dealt with failed transactions when trying to mint the NFTs.

In total, there will be 200,000 Otherdeeds NFTs. In addition to the 55,000 NFTs offered for purchase on May 1, 45,000 NFTs can be claimed by owners of Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs. 15,000 Otherdeeds NFTs will be going to Yuga Labs and other developers associated with the project, and the remaining 85,000 NFTs will be distributed to Otherdeeds owners.

Yuga Labs commented on the controversies surrounding the mint, saying that they will be refunding the gas paid by users who had failed transactions. Notably, the team says “it seems abundantly clear” that ApeCoin will require its own blockchain platform to meet the project’s scaling demands and encouraged the ApeCoin DAO “to start thinking in this direction”.

We're sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while. It seems abundantly clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale. We'd like to encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) May 1, 2022

2022-05-11,The User Experience of Futures Trading on Three Crypto Exchanges - Cryptonews,"The User Experience of Futures Trading on Three Crypto Exchanges

Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.

Before we get started, let’s first check the background information: As a beginner investor who has just joined the crypto sector and tried entry-level products like spot trading on several exchanges, I now plan to venture into the futures market and earn more profits by trading futures. Today, let’s check out how I opened a futures position on three crypto exchanges (Binance, KuCoin, and CoinEx) and see which platform provides the best functions (PS: personal experience & for reference only).

I. Binance

Let’s begin with the futures segment of Binance, which primarily covers crypto futures that include USDT-M Futures (linear contracts), Coin-M Futures (inverse contracts), Binance Leveraged Tokens, and Binance Options. More specifically, users can trade USDT-M Futures and Coin-M Futures directly on the Binance webpage. To trade Binance Options, however, investors must also download the Binance app. As for Binance Leveraged Tokens, since there are no operating guides, novices who are not familiar with leveraged tokens might get confused at the very beginning.

Here, I went with USDT-M Futures and entered the BTC/USDT futures market. As shown in the picture below, the left side of the page shows the current market conditions and the order book, while users can select the margin model and order type on the right side of the page. On Binance, users can place 7 types of orders, including Limit, Market, Stop Limit, etc., and choose to buy long or sell short. After opening a position, they can check open orders and trade history at the bottom of the page.

It should be noted that users must go through KYC authentication before trading futures on Binance. Moreover, to get started with Binance products & services (e.g. crypto deposits, trades, and withdrawals), both old and new users must first complete KYC authentication.

Overall, as a world-leading crypto exchange, Binance offers a full range of crypto futures and a well-designed webpage. However, there are no operating guides, and users need to spend extra time learning how to trade futures on the exchange. At the same time, to trade futures on Binance, users must complete KYC authentication. Additionally, they should also be careful with the platform as it faced many user rights protection issues, including manipulation of the candlestick chart and malicious liquidation of positions.

II. KuCoin

KuCoin’s crypto contract segment now features futures contracts and leveraged tokens. The futures page of KuCoin is pretty similar to that of Binance — the current market conditions and order book are on the left, and the margin model and order type are on the right. Meanwhile, KuCoin also provides a wide range of functions, ranging from the Contract Calculator to Take Profit & Stop Loss. However, on KuCoin, traders can only place limit/stop orders.

KuCoin only provides less than 100 USDT-margined futures markets, which indicates a lack of diversity. In addition, USD 280 million worth of assets were stolen from KuCoin in September 2020, which marked the biggest crypto hack that year. Therefore, before joining KuCoin, investors should carefully examine the platform’s security.

III. CoinEx

On CoinEx, all crypto contracts are futures. Users can trade linear/inverse contracts (the equivalent of USDT-M Futures and Coin-M Futures on Binance and KuCoin ). Users can click on [Futures] in the navigation bar to start trading futures.

The futures page of CoinEx is simple and straightforward, with clear-cut segments. Unlike Binance or KuCoin, CoinEx offers four types of futures: limit orders, market orders, stop-limit orders, and stop-market orders. It should also be noted that CoinEx placed the Futures Tutorial on the top of order settings to help users learn how to trade futures by simply watching the tutorial video and completing the quiz. The Futures Tutorial allows users to get started with futures trading on CoinEx quickly and conveniently.

CoinEx also offers functions like TP & SL and a contract calculator. Moreover, the platform allows users to close positions with one click. Overall, CoinEx’s futures page is more straightforward than that of Binance or KuCoin, and is easier on the eye. Additionally, CoinEx does not require futures traders to go through KYC authentication, which is more convenient for people like me who do not plan on completing any KYC authentication anytime soon. To open a position and start trading futures on CoinEx, users only have to log in to their CoinEx account and transfer assets into the futures account.

It is worth mentioning that CoinEx has always been noted as an extremely secure platform in the industry. The exchange has never been hacked in the past 5 years since its inception. As a reassuring exchange, CoinEx is backed by strong products & technologies, as well as enhanced asset security.

In conclusion, after comparing the futures provided by the three platforms, Binance provides a comprehensive, professional futures segment that features a large number of markets but requires KYC authentication, which is bad news for beginner traders or users in a country/region where KYC authentication is not allowed. In addition, Binance has suffered many scandals. On the other hand, futures products provided by KuCoin and CoinEx are both beginner-friendly, with a full range of basic functions and easy operations. Yet when it comes to security and ease of use, CoinEx is the obvious winner.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy91c2VyLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utb2YtZnV0dXJlcy10cmFkaW5nLXRocmVlLWNyeXB0by1leGNoYW5nZXMuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-17,BitMEX Expands its Crypto Trading Offering with Spot Exchange - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Popular crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX has launched spot markets

Users can buy and sell BTC, ETH, APE, UNI, MATIC, LINK, and AXS in USDT trading pairs

BitMEX is celebrating the launch of its spot exchange platform with a $1 million giveaway and BMEX token reward promotion

The BitMEX Spot exchange goes live, BMEX token coming soon

BitMEX, one of the most popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms, has expanded its suite of trading products and services with the launch of the BitMEX Spot exchange. The exchange currently supports seven cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, APE, UNI, MATIC, LINK, and AXS. According to a blog post, additional digital currencies, including BitMEX’s own BMEX token, are “due to arrive in the coming months.”

The leading crypto derivatives exchange first announced plans to provide its users with exposure to physical digital assets in April. At the time, the company also revealed it is looking to launch brokerage and crypto custody services as well as secure additional regulatory licenses.

BitMEX Spot exchange allows users to place market and limit orders, depending on their preference and trading precision requirements. All digital currencies included in the offering can be traded in trading pairs with Tether’s USDT. BitMEX maker and taker trading fees start at 0.10% and can go as low as 0.00% for the largest volume traders on the platform.

The company is celebrating the launch of spot markets with a two-month-long Sweepstakes promotion with a prize pool of over $1 million. Users will be able to earn crypto rewards and various merchandise depending on their trading volume. In addition, BitMEX is granting the first 10,000 newly verified depositors a chance to earn up to 20 BMEX. Moreover, additional BMEX token rewards will be distributed among the first 10,000 users to trade spot pairs on BitMEX.

Founded in 2014, BitMEX was at one point the largest crypto derivatives platform in the sector. However, the rise of competitors like Binance Futures, Deribit, Bybit, and FTX, as well as BitMEX’s own regulatory troubles, saw the company’s market share dwindle. Earlier this year, BitMEX hired a new CEO Alexander Höptner to lead the company’s “transformation from a crypto derivatives exchange to something bigger.”

BitMEX has handled more than $830 million in trading volume over the last 24 hours, with XBTUSD Bitcoin perpetual futures contract accounting for nearly three-quarters of the exchange’s entire trading volume.

2022-05-06,How to Earn 15% Interest on Your UST Holdings with Flexible Staking on Bybit? - CoinCodex,"Cryptocurrency investors often wonder how to make the most out of their cryptocurrency holdings. Some people try to time the markets with an active trading strategy, or even trade cryptocurrency futures with leverage. Active trading strategies introduce additional risks, and many crypto investors prefer a more passive approach. Thankfully, there’s plenty of ways to passively grow your cryptocurrency holdings while keeping risks relatively low. One of the most popular ways to generate passive income with crypto is staking.

Staking is a passive way of earning rewards on your crypto holdings

If you hold a cryptocurrency that’s secured through Proof-of-Stake, you can stake or delegate your coins directly on the blockchain and earn staking rewards in return. Alternatively, you can use staking services offered by cryptocurrency exchanges. These services also make it possible for you to stake crypto assets like Bitcoin, which don’t utilize a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.

The Bybit cryptocurrency exchange offers a Flexible Savings product allows users to stake their cryptocurrency and earn yield on it. The yields are expressed as APY (annual percentage year), which shows how much interest would be earned if the coins were staked for one year. For example, if you staked 1,000 coins in a Flexible Savings with an APY of 5%, you would earn 50 coins if you held the stake for a year.

There is a broad selection of assets supported on Flexible Savings, including low market cap altcoins, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and stablecoins. The APYs can vary greatly depending on the staked asset—as a general rule, we can say that more established crypto assets offer lower staking yields, but this isn’t always the case.

Some staking programs require users to lock up their cryptocurrency for a specified period of time. This is not the case with Flexible Savings on Bybit, as users are free to unstake their crypto at any time.

How to stake UST and earn rewards on Bybit?

In this article, we’ll be going through the process of staking the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin in Bybit’s Flexible Savings product. At the time of writing, Bybit is offering a 15% APY on UST staked in Flexible Savings. Most of what we will be covering in this guide applies to all the coins that can be staked on Flexible Savings, so you can get some valuable insights even if you’re looking to stake another coin.

Before we continue with our step-by-step guide, we should mention that some Flexible Savings programs on Bybit are only offered for a limited time. Depending on when you’re reading this guide, it’s possible that the program featured in the guide is no longer available, or that the staking rewards have changed. Check the official Bybit website to see the most up-to-date rates and coins supported for Flexible Savings.

Step-by-step guide

Before you get started, you’ll have to create an account on Bybit. Bybit is a popular cryptocurrency exchange that offers a full suite of cryptocurrency services, including spot and derivatives trading, passive income products, token sales and more.

Create Bybit Account

You will also have to get your hands on some UST. If you already own UST, you can simply deposit it to Bybit. Of course, you can also use Bybit to purchase UST—you can check out our guide explaining how to buy crypto on Bybit.

How to buy cryptocurrency on Bybit?

1. Transfer UST to your Earn account

Once you have some UST on Bybit, you will have to transfer it to your Spot account to your Earn account if you want to use it in Flexible Savings. Go to your spot account, click “Transfer” and enter the amount you wish to transfer. Internal transfers between your Bybit accounts are instant and free.

After the transfer is complete, you can check the balance in your Earn account. If you click the “Earn” button, you’ll be taken to an overview of the different passive income products offered by Bybit.

2. Find the UST Flexible Savings program

In this example, the Flexible Savings program for UST is already featured in the “Trending” section. If you can’t find it here, click on the “Flexible Savings” tab. Click the “Buy Now” button to proceed.

3. Stake your UST

In the confirmation window, you can see the overview of the staking, including the estimated daily yield. To stake, click on Stake Now.

Congratulations, you’ve successfully staked 100 UST with a 15% APY!

4. Track your staking progress or unstake your UST

If you want to track the progress of your UST stake and the yield you’ve earned so far, you’ll need to navigate to the “Flexible Staking” subsection of your Earn account. If you wish to stop staking your UST, you can click on “Unstake”. The Flexible Savings product allows you to unstake your staked coins at any time.

Additional considerations

While staking on cryptocurrency exchanges like Bybit is a relatively safe way to grow your cryptocurrency holdings, every earning opportunity comes with certain risks. In the case of staking programs like Flexible Savings, the biggest risk is that you have to trust the exchange to handle the staked coins responsibly. Cryptocurrency exchanges are an attractive target for hackers, and your coins could be stolen in a security breach. You also have to take steps to appropriately secure your account with a strong password, 2-factor authentication and other means.

Staking cryptocurrency will grow your crypto holdings—in other words, you will end up with more coins than you began with. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the value of your investment will grow. If the price of the coin you’re staking drops, the overall value of your investment could decrease even though you earned additional coins through staking. This isn’t really a problem if you are staking stablecoins (assuming they maintain their peg), but should be a consideration if you’re looking to stake other types of cryptocurrency.

The bottom line

Bybit’s Flexible Savings product is a convenient and low-risk way of passively growing your cryptocurrency holdings. The product offers attractive yields and supports a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. If you don’t plan on actively trading your cryptocurrencies, it’s certainly worth considering staking them in Flexible Savings on Bybit. Hopefully, this guide helped you get started with earning yield on your UST.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NTQ5L2hvdy10by1lYXJuLTE1LWludGVyZXN0LW9uLXlvdXItdXN0LWhvbGRpbmdzLXdpdGgtZmxleGlibGUtc3Rha2luZy1vbi1ieWJpdC_SAXNodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDU0OS9ob3ctdG8tZWFybi0xNS1pbnRlcmVzdC1vbi15b3VyLXVzdC1ob2xkaW5ncy13aXRoLWZsZXhpYmxlLXN0YWtpbmctb24tYnliaXQv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-26,Building a Launchpad for Crypto Projects - Interview With Infinity Rocket (IRT) Project Founders - CoinCodex,"The Infinity Rocket community members ask plenty of questions in chats. Usually, the most interesting thing for them is news that can move markets for the IRT token. We talked to the project's founders to learn valuable information about the Infinity Rocket platform and the IRT token.

The IRT token smart-contract was released on September 17th, 2021. Today it is traded on PancakeSwap, Coinsbit and Bitrue. The trading volume is about $2 million daily. How do you rate the “flight” of your rocket after 8 months?

As far as you can see, we have an astronaut on our logo, it’s our mascot. If we go on speaking about the project in the “space” language then since the very beginning our spaceship has entered the right orbit and sticks to the given plan. Seriously though, we are proud that all the iRocket Road Map goals are done despite all the storms. Our team proves its efficiency under any circumstances.

What turned out easier to deal with and what made you work harder?

Every single project has its own character. Even if you have created and launched dozens of tokens to crypto exchanges you need to adapt to each of them. However, the unsolvable problems do not appear. We have a really coordinated team so we are always taking higher goals to develop. The tempo we have maintained for 8 months proves it right. We appreciate the new challenges, the dynamics. It is urgent to stay focused.

The marketing experts say that a unique proposition is necessary to succeed. What makes the Infinity Rocket Launchpad Platform special?

That is a good question. This is one of our favorite points of discussion “Who are you?” and “What do you do to change the World?”. We are working on the full cycle platform that should contain the startups and the blockchain professionals, also traders.

We are working on the service that allows to walk the safe way from the idea to the token launch on the biggest international exchanges. We are creating the product we would doubtlessly use ourselves when we were launching our first tokens.

Could you tell us about your current team?

The sense of any structure is formed by the core. This very core of the Infinity Rocket team consists of professional traders, IT-architects and programmers, marketing experts. Such projects can not exist without these specialists. Furthermore, we have lawyers, social media specialists and web-developers who work on separate tasks.

By the way, all of us are crypto-enthusiasts as we were one of the first to work in this sphere since its establishment. Now our international team core numbers 12 people.

There are several companies that follow the strategy of full publicity. Their founders are public figures, they speak at different conferences. They also publish their private photos on social media. You hold a different point of view—could you tell us more about it?

All of us were public figures with boosted accounts and a resume. Although united by the idea and aspiration of making a great project we do not focus on promoting all of the team members. We are focused on our business. Some of us continue working officially for the huge international companies at the high positions. The project has its officials, legal address and company. But let me get that straight we appreciate privacy and anonymity, we even mentioned it on our website. Moreover, we respect our partners’ and clients’ privacy rights and they are grateful for this.

We can frequently come across the information about the project advisors from the CryptoMaximum company in your posts. What do they do?

We have been cooperating for a long time with the CryptoMaximum group since blockchain conferences. They develop trading and market making areas in our project. The professional impact in this sphere is rather important. Also, we hold some marketing activities in the CryptoMaximum community to promote the IRT token.

What perspectives does IRT have this summer? Surely, everyone is waiting for the rockets and new Xes. What can we expect?

Right, everyone loves insider information. When being traders we also learnt to read between the lines. Now we are ready to announce some most important upcoming events.

Soon there will be a new listing on a big exchange (TOP 20) and a great promotion. This will bring additional attention to our token and expand our community.

Also, we are going to demonstrate the beta-version of some service products for launchpad and new projects promotion. This product is unique and we are its authors. To estimate the platform functions we are going to form a focus-group from the most active members of our community.

The project is developing rapidly and the IRT chart is the proof of our professional input.

On May 23rd, 2022 you burnt 1% of the project tokens. How did it influence the price and why was it necessary?

Burning is an instrument that allows you to manage the number of tokens in circulation. This process leads to the price increase of tokens in circulation. This is a benefit for investors. For the project this process is some kind of an activity growth driver, a powerful stimulus of product added value increase.

Until 2030 we will have burnt no less than 30% of tokens and, as for the whole living cycle of the product, we will burn 50% of all the tokens in circulation. Every integration will be followed by some massive PR-campaigns, new functional product blocks launching to save and increase the Infinity Rocket capitalization growth.

Let us speak about the chart. How can you describe the nature of the IRT token price movement?

The token price surely shows an uptrend since its launch. The previous events on the market in May 2022 illustrated that our token did not renew the minimums during some tough periods. We are working hard every day to maintain this confident growth tendency because the token price increase and the community expansion are related to the realization of our plans.

When the trading started on September 23rd in 2021 on PancakeSwap the token cost 0.00035 USD and reached 0.05 USD within a month and a half, the increase was more than 14,000%. The number of token holders have reached 14,000 at the moment which shows the trust level of the community.

What advice can you give to the investors?

Probably, it will not sound unique but there is an important criteria of choosing the project for investing. “You should always rate the idea, the product and the team”. Most important are distant things: the results, plan executions, reaching the goals and the active work on the product.

However, if you enter some great project at a high price, you should be ready to lose some money, especially for a short period of time. That is why when you choose wisely and rate the fundamental characteristics you gain more than hype assets trade.

Remember: a long-term investor earns more than a short-term trader. However, you should take your time. If you want to make a long-term investment, you should choose high qualified projects. Nobody is a good investor in the beginning of his path. What forms the professionalism is persistence, constant self-educating and the experience of overcoming the obstacles.

Good luck! Join us, we will be glad to communicate.

2022-05-25,FIREPIN Token (FRPN) Competes With The Popularity of Meme Coins Such as Samoyedcoin (SAMO) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) - CoinCodex,"Cryptocurrencies are usually equated to stocks to put the concept of blockchain into perspective. The cryptocurrencies, in addition to being investment opportunities, also function as products that require to be backed by functional features, marketing and customer (investor, in this case) satisfaction.

The best marketing that happens for cryptocurrencies always unfurls on the internet and social media. These platforms are efficiently harnessed by meme coins to grip on to popularity.

What Are Meme Coins?

Meme coins are usually created as a tribute to a meme, which is a humorous notion captured in an image, video, or another medium. Meme coins, like the memes they're based on, are intended to go viral and be shared. Unlike other tokens, such cryptocurrencies are not oriented toward problem-solving. Since it is dependent on the endorsement of influencers, community activities, excitement, and FOMO, the value of a meme currency swings with market interest.

Several crypto tokens emerged as meme coins and have performed well in the market. Certain examples would be Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Dogecoin (DOGE), Samoyedcoin (SAMO), etc.

As one may expect, Samoyedcoin (SAMO) is another dog-themed cryptocurrency that has now partnered with Solana (SOL). According to a statement by Samoyedcoin itself, ""at its core, SAMO is an emerging digital asset that backs a community concentrated on onboarding Solana users"". Furthermore, SAMO is designed to create scarcity for its coin. Since its establishment, it has completed three burns. In its tokenomics, oversupply is one of the main areas that SAMO intends to tackle.

Can Investing In Meme Coin Backfire?

Unlike most crypto tokens or fiat currencies, meme coins frequently have an unlimited supply which means their availability is limitless which further leads to high volatility in their value.

From legal troubles in the United Kingdom to a recent reduction in interest in meme coins, the price of Floki Inu has dropped by 90% in 2022. Floki Inu (FLOKI) emerged as Dogecoin's and Shiba Inu's most serious challenger. However, its aggressive marketing techniques have spelled bad news for it. Floki Inu recently announced a new marketing campaign that states that the cryptocurrency will be advertised on 100 buses and 203 posters will be placed around London's metro stations. The crypto's efforts to build a decentralised monetary fund have already angered UK legislators. The new campaign aspires to become a spokesperson for all meme coins but is facing friction from authoritative figures.

It is instances like these which remind the investors how tricky it is to trust meme coins that are constantly swayed by whimsical controversies and unforeseen trends on the internet.

The Marketing Technique of Firepin (FRPN)

The best marketing tool that FIREPIN Token (FRPN) has adopted is its well-constructed whitepaper. FIREPIN Token (FRPN) is a new entry into the crypto market and has some promising features which are actively being noticed by analysts. It offers an NFT platform where subdivisions of NFT can be traded for the maximum profit within the holistic FIREPIN Metaverse. It is also a DAO token that rewards the investors with decision-making powers and creates space for a democratic financial investment.

2022-05-13,FreshCut (FCD) on Bybit Launchpool - Earn FCD by Staking BIT or FCD - CoinCodex,"Bybit has announced that FreshCut (FCD) will be the next project featured on Bybit Launchpool. Bybit Launchpool is a product by the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to earn tokens from exciting blockchain projects simply by staking tokens. Depending on the specific Launchpool, users can earn rewards in one or multiple different tokens. For the FreshCut Launchpool program, Bybit users can earn FCD tokens by staking BIT or FCD. Larger BIT stakes earn higher rewards – the rewards you receive depend on how large your BIT or FCD stake is compared to the size of the entire BIT or FCD staking pool.

Bybit Launchpool is a low-risk way of earning some extra tokens from new and exciting blockchain projects. This is because you don’t need to spend any tokens in order to get the rewards, and you can unstake the staked tokens at any time.

Bybit will distribute 2,625,000 FCD tokens through its Launchpool. The program is taking place between 10AM UTC on May 10, 2022 to 1PM UTC on May 19, 2022.

Who is eligible for the FreshCut Launchpool on Bybit?

There are two criteria users must meet before they can earn FCD tokens on Bybit Launchpool. You need to have completed KYC Level 1 verification on Bybit, and have at least 100 BIT or 1,000 FCD tokens to stake. The maximum amount of BIT tokens that can be staked in the FreshCut Launchpool program is 30,000 BIT or 300,000 FCD. You can find up-to-date rules about FreshCut on Bybit Launchpool here.

How to earn FCD tokens on Bybit Launchpool?

Now that we’ve gone through the most important facts about FreshCut on Bybit Launchpool, let’s go through the step-by-step process for how you can participate and earn FCD rewards. The first step is to register an account on Bybit.

Create Bybit Account

Once your Bybit account is ready to go, you’ll have to complete the KYC Level 1 identity verification process. You can do so by going to the “Account & Security” section of your Bybit profile and selecting “Verify Now” under the “Identity Verification” tab. Follow the instructions provided by the exchange.

If you don’t already have BIT or FCD tokens in your Bybit account, you’ll have to deposit them to the exchange or purchase them on Bybit. The minimum amount of BIT that you can stake for the FreshCut program on Bybit Launchpool is 100 BIT, while the minimum for FCD stakers is 1,000 FCD.

How to buy cryptocurrency on Bybit?

Once your account is verified and you hold the minimum amount of BIT, you’re ready to start earning FCD tokens on Bybit Launchpool. Select “Launchpool” under the “Earn” section of the Bybit interface.

You will see the list of active pools on Bybit Launchpool. In this example, we can see that there are two staking pools for BIT and FCD, respectively.

Select “Stake Now” and enter the amount of BIT or FCD tokens that you want to stake. Make sure to familiarize yourself with Bybit’s terms of service before continuing.

Please note that the screenshot provided below is from a previous staking promotion on Bybit Launchpool. However, the same principles apply to the staking pools for earning FCD rewards.

You will receive the FCD tokens you earn in your ByFi Account, which you can view under the “Assets” tab. If you want to check the rewards you’ve earned or want to unstake your BIT, you can go to ByFi Account → Orders → Launchpool.

How are rewards calculated?

There’s a few things we need to point out when it comes to earning rewards on Bybit Launchpool. Here’s how Bybit explains the way daily rewards are calculated:

Let’s assume that you’ve staked token α to earn a new token β:

Your daily yield for β = (the amount of α you’ve staked to the α pool / total number of α staked to the α pool by the all participants) * daily β prize pool

Your rewards will start being calculated one day after you staked your BIT tokens. The daily rewards will be deposited into your ByFi Account once a day.

The bottom line

Bybit Launchpool is a useful product that will be especially attractive to BIT token holders. Through Launchpool, users can get their hands on new and exciting tokens without taking on any additional risks. Typically, the tokens you earn on Bybit Launchpool get listed on the Bybit exchange shortly after the Launchpool program concludes, which means that you can sell your rewards or purchase additional tokens. The 100 BIT minimum is also quite low, so Bybit Launchpool staking is accessible to almost everyone.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NjkzL2ZyZXNoY3V0LWZjZC1vbi1ieWJpdC1sYXVuY2hwb29sLWVhcm4tZmNkLWJ5LXN0YWtpbmctYml0LW9yLWZjZC_SAWdodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDY5My9mcmVzaGN1dC1mY2Qtb24tYnliaXQtbGF1bmNocG9vbC1lYXJuLWZjZC1ieS1zdGFraW5nLWJpdC1vci1mY2Qv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-05-04,Elon Musk Features Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs in New Twitter Profile Picture - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

Elon Musk's new Twitter profile picture featuring images of NFTs from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection

It's unlikely that Musk actually owns the NFTs featured in the image, as it appears to have been sourced from the website of auction house Sotheby's

Musk also posted a tweet that could be interpreted as a humorous jab at NFTs

Elon Musk features Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs in Twitter profile picture

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has changed his Twitter profile picture to a collage featuring images of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible tokens NFTs.

The NFT featured in the centre of the image is of BAYC #5809, which is owned by an address that has multiple other NFTs from the collection, as well as an assortment of other NFTs from collections like Otherdeeds.

Elon Musk's new profile picture features Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. Image source: Twitter

By itself, the fact that BAYC #5809 is featured prominently in Elon Musk’s new Twitter profile picture isn’t an indication that Musk owns the NFT. In fact, the image appears to be sourced from the website of the Sotheby’s auction house, and features BAYC NFTs that were auctioned off in a lot for $24.39 million by BAYC creators Yuga Labs.

Musk doesn't appear to be a big fan of NFTs

In addition to changing his profile picture, Musk also posted a tweet saying “I dunno … seems kinda fungible”, which could be interpreted as a humorous jab at NFTs. Critics and skeptics often make fun of NFTs by saving and reposting images of NFTs on platforms like Twitter, ostensibly to show that the images represented by NFTs can easily be copied and redistributed by anyone.

I dunno … seems kinda fungible — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 4, 2022

From what we know so far, it seems that Musk isn’t exactly a fan of NFTs. In a tweet posted in January, Musk called Twitter’s NFT profile picture feature “annoying”. In a subsequent tweet, Musk questioned why Twitter was using its engineering resources on the feature while the platform was facing a serious problem with spam bots.

Regardless of what Musk’s intentions behind the new profile picture might be, his move is sure to stir up discussion and speculation about BAYC and NFTs in general. ApeCoin (APE), a token closely associated with the BAYC ecosystem, displayed a quick price spike in response to the news. The APE price jumped by around 19% in the space of an hour, but has since corrected from a local peak at $17.40 to about $15.42 at the time of writing.

Yuga Labs recently raised more than $300 million by selling 55,000 Otherdeeds NFTs, which represent claims to virtual land in the Otherside metaverse. Demand for the sale, which was conducted exclusively with ApeCoin, was so high that transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain temporarily increased to extreme levels. In Otherside, holders of NFTs from collections like BAYC will be able to use their NFTs as avatars. Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT holders can claim Otherdeeds for free (except for applicable gas fees).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NDkwL2Vsb24tbXVzay1mZWF0dXJlcy1ib3JlZC1hcGUteWFjaHQtY2x1Yi1uZnRzLWluLW5ldy10d2l0dGVyLXByb2ZpbGUtcGljdHVyZS_SAXNodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDQ5MC9lbG9uLW11c2stZmVhdHVyZXMtYm9yZWQtYXBlLXlhY2h0LWNsdWItbmZ0cy1pbi1uZXctdHdpdHRlci1wcm9maWxlLXBpY3R1cmUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-06-25,How dApps Built on NEAR Protocol Change the Way the Digital Money Flows - CoinCodex,"How dApps Built on NEAR Protocol Change the Way the Digital Money Flows

The NEAR Protocol is a proof-of-stake (PoS) powered protocol and Ethereum competitor that enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). While the projects on offer through the NEAR Protocol might resemble those on Ethereum and other dApp-focused platforms, NEAR solves the problem of scalability.

Through its PoS consensus method, NEAR ensures that dApps built on its platform can harness the power of thousands of transactions per second without charging exorbitant fees at the same time. Such capabilities increase the likelihood of dApps that require smaller, more frequent transactions like games, as users won’t have to pay hefty fees for every interaction.

By streamlining and lowering the cost of transactions on its protocol, NEAR is changing the way digital money flows, creating a barrier-free way for users to make, save, and move money around.

Now, let’s take a look at some of the most exciting and innovative dApps developers are building on NEAR, and how they’re serving users in ways unlike before.

Spin.fi

Spin.fi is a decentralized exchange that combines the offerings provided by both centralized and decentralized platforms.

For instance, users can earn passive income by providing liquidity to various protocols, while traders might appreciate instant, low-fee transactions and order book matching. For their efforts, users earn some of Spin’s different tokens that they can then use to trade or stake within the platform.

Such capabilities are only possible within the NEAR platform thanks to its PoS consensus that supports hundreds of near-instant transactions with minimal fees.

Roketo

Roketo is a crypto financial streaming service that allows companies to automate their payroll and process payments in real-time. It changes the nature of financial transactions as it allows one to allocate funds transparently over large periods of time.

Streams take less than one minute to set up, can be paused and resumed at any time, and can be shared publicly. On top of the payroll, the service works great for vesting tokens, airdrops, and pay-per-minute services such as music or video streaming. With NEAR’s commissions of less than $1, recipients can withdraw their funds as easily as they do with fiat money.

Pulse Markets

Pulse Markets is a Web 3 prediction market aiming to fix the issues of current prediction markets, in that many traditional ones retain access to users’ funds while selling their personal information.

Pulse enables anyone to establish a prediction market based on whatever assets or market they’d like, utilizing a unique decentralized oracle infrastructure to pull price feeds and other information from the real world. Transactions are near-instant and cost next to nothing, thanks to the power of NEAR.

NearPay

NearPay is the first NEAR Protocol-supported debit card that links fiat and crypto. The project comes in the form of a digital app and a physical card. Aslo, NearPay provides a widget that allows merchants to integrate support of the NEAR Protocol and other crypto, so users can spend their hard-earned tokens on real-world goods.

While the project’s first cards are releasing in Europe, they plan to expand on a global scale in due time.

NearPad

NearPad considers itself NEAR’s DeFi hub, featuring a DEX and a LaunchPad for developers to build their dApps and list their tokens for trade.

By offering one space for users to build and harness the power of dApps, NearPad facilitates innovation within its ecosystem while ensuring all trades and transactions cost next to nothing, thanks to NEAR Protocol’s capabilities.

NEAR Crowd

NEAR Crowd is a dApp providing users with passive income for taking on and completing small requests made by the community. For example, a user creates a task asking others to describe what is in an image. Another user will take that task and complete it. However, for that user to get paid for their efforts, others must validate that the task was completed correctly.

If a user completes the task correctly, according to the reviewer, both they and the user who did the task earn NEAR for their efforts. The idea is for users to earn passive income for helping out others in their spare time, incentivizing productivity and teamwork.

Such a project focuses on the smaller transactions in the digital realm, ensuring users can pay one another for services no matter how diminutive.

Conclusion

The NEAR protocol provides developers with more ways to manage the flow of digital funds than ever before while minimizing the cost of transactions. NEAR processes are also near-instant, minimizing the wait time for users to take advantage of such benefits.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE2MDc1L2hvdy1kYXBwcy1idWlsdC1vbi1uZWFyLXByb3RvY29sLWNoYW5nZS10aGUtd2F5LXRoZS1kaWdpdGFsLW1vbmV5LWZsb3dzL9IBb2h0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE2MDc1L2hvdy1kYXBwcy1idWlsdC1vbi1uZWFyLXByb3RvY29sLWNoYW5nZS10aGUtd2F5LXRoZS1kaWdpdGFsLW1vbmV5LWZsb3dzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-05-20,"Bitcoin Price Analysis - BTC Clings Onto $30,000, but Which Way Will the Triangle Break Moving Into the Weekend? - CoinCodex","Bitcoin Price Analysis - BTC Clings Onto $30,000, but Which Way Will the Triangle Break Moving Into the Weekend?

Key highlights:

Bitcoin is up 2.5% today as the bulls try to reclaim the $30,000 level

The number one ranked cryptocurrency continues to trade inside the established range between $31,000 and $28,650 (June 2021 low) this week

A new short-term triangle has formed as we head into the weekend

Bitcoin price $29,800 Key BTC resistance levels $30,500, $31,000 $31,650, $32,000, $32,270 Key BTC support levels $30,000, $29,350, $29,000, $28,650, $28,226

*Price at the time of publication

Bitcoin holders are still on the edge of their seats as they wait for signals that will dictate how the current phase of short-term consolidation will play out. As most of you know, the market took a tumble last week as the number one ranked cryptocurrency fell from above $36,000 to reach as low as $25,485 during the capitulation.

Since then, the buyers have regrouped and have formed a short-term trading range between $31,000 and $28,650 (June 2021 lows). During the week, the market did break beneath a short-term triangle pattern (4hr charts), but the buyers defended the June 2021 lows, allowing the market to rebound above $30,000.

A new triangle has formed on the 4hour charts and will be the next pattern to watch moving into the weekend (see analysis below).

While traders wait for the market to provide an indication of where it would like to head next, the fundamentals continue to remain equally uncertain. With the Fed expected to continue to raise interest rates, and the ongoing fear that the Terra ecosystem collapse caused, it feels like the entire market sentiment is in a dark place.

It seems that whales are continuing to dominate the heavy volatility right now. According to the Exchange Whale Ratio, an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten BTC transactions to exchanges against total exchange inflows, it seems that whales continue to dominate the inflows to exchanges.

Typically, a value above 85% means that whales currently make up a large part of the overall exchange inflows. But, as you can see, today’s value is touching the 90% mark - indicating that retail investors are at the whim of the whales right now.

Interestingly, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score from Glassnode suggests that there is still some strong buy-side activity taking place. Last week, when the market collapsed beneath $25,000, the Accumulation Trend Score saw a sharp reversal in which it went from weak values beneath 0.3 to climb back toward 0.796.

When a large proportion of the market is adding to their on-chain balances, the Accumulation Trend Score tends to head back toward 1. This rise in accumulation was the main reason why Bitcoin managed to reclaim $30,000 this week.

Digging deeper, it seems that smaller holders with less than 1 BTC in their wallets were by far the biggest accumulators in the drop

Slightly larger holders helped these small holders with between 1 to 10 BTC in their wallets. The fact that the smaller holders feel comfortable adding to their holdings is a strong bullish signal as they expect that the market dumps might not continue for much longer.

With the market still sitting in uncertain conditions, let us continue to look at where the support is ahead.

Bitcoin price analysis

Daily chart

4-hour chart

What has been going on?

Looking at the daily chart above, we can see that the June 2021 low at $28,650 has been extremely important in preventing further declines this week. However, it is also important to note that Wednesday’s closing candle was lower than the 2022 low-day closing candle, which could be considered a bearish factor moving forward.

Looking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that the market broke the previous triangle (dashed line) but has now formed a slightly longer termed triangle. After breaking beneath the previous triangle, BTC/USD fell into the June 2021 lows but has since rebounded from this level, allowing BTC to maintain itself above $30,000.

Bitcoin price short-term prediction: Bearish

Bitcoin continues to remain bearish in the short term. BTC would need to break and close beneath the January 2021 lows for the bearish pressure to continue further. To be considered neutral again, the coin would need to break back above $35,000 - strong January 2022 support. To be considered bullish, it would have to continue above the May highs at $40,000.

Toward the upside, resistance is first located at the upper angle of the current triangle. This is followed by resistance at $31,000. Additional resistance lies at the June 2021 LDC of $31,650, $32,000 (100-day MA), $32,950, $33,000, $33,520, $34,000, $35,000, and $36,000.

Where is the support beneath $30,000?

On the other side, the first support now lies at $29,850 (50-day MA). This is followed by support at $29,350 (July 2021 lows), $29,000, and $28,650 (June 2021 lows & lower angle of triangle). If the sellers break beneath the triangle, additional support ies expected at $28,225 (downside 1.414 Fib Extension), $28,000, and $27,750 (Jan 2021 lows).

Beneath the January 2021 lows, support is expected at $27,000, $25,885, $25,485 (last week’s low), and $25,000.

So, where are we heading next?

Although the previous short-term triangle broke to the downside, the new triangle provides a little more hope. However, symmetrical triangles typically break in the direction of the previous trend which, in this case, would be bearish.

We would need to wait for a breakout of the current triangle for the market to provide an indication about where it would like to head next. If the current triangle does break, the June 2021 lows and the January 2021 lows would be the next critical support to defend.

2022-06-24,Confio and Interchain Foundation Partners with Composable Finance for Hackathon at Unchained Berlin - CoinCodex,"It's the season of blockchain events and hackathons. Composable Finance is partnering with innovative blockchain developing firm Confio and decentralized non-profit Interchain Foundation to present the first-ever cross-chain hackathon, powered by the Composable cross-chain virtual machine (XCVM).

Earlier this month, Composable Finance announced that it would be holding its inaugural cross-chain conference in Berlin, the Unchained Conference. The event, taking place at the Alte Münze on July 1 in Berlin, will feature the following:

Representation of renowned individuals from the DotSama, EVM and Cosmos ecosystems each presenting Keynote speeches.

Panel sessions from web3 industry thought leaders.

The grand unveiling of Composable’s cross-chain virtual machine XCVM.

The Unchained Hackathon where participants get to win up to $10,000 in prizes for building on the XCVM.

How to Participate in the Unchained Demo

Hackathons are a time to birth new products and test new ideas and the limits of an existing product. Hence, participants get up to five hours at the Composable Unchained hackathon to develop innovative solutions that leverage the XCVM.

The hackathon will have representatives from Composable, Confio and Interchain mentoring the participants throughout the event. The teams will be split into Rust and Solidity developers, and UI/UX designers are welcomed as well. At the end of the hackathon, the winning team gets up to $10,000 in prize money after solving various challenges using CosmWasm cross-chain smart contracts they deploy on XCVM.

Attendees of the Unchained conference get to witness not only the unveiling of the XCVM and the birth of new ideas via the hackathon in real-time.

2022-05-16,How to Transfer USDT from Coinbase to Bybit? - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Coinbase and Bybit are two of the most widely used cryptocurrency exchanges in the sector

Transferring USDT between exchanges provides traders with an opportunity to pursue investment opportunities on different platforms

This guide includes a complete and detailed step-by-step guide on sending USDT from Coinbase to Bybit

How to transfer Tether (USDT) from Coinbase to Bybit?

Cryptocurrency exchange platforms provide different services for users. Some of the services are exclusive to a single exchange. For this reason, users often have to migrate their crypto holdings between different digital asset trading platforms. Coinbase and Bybit are two well-known and secure exchanges, each offering its own set of features. In this article, we will provide you with the full guide showing how to send Tether (USDT) from Coinbase to Bybit.

About Coinbase

Coinbase is the most popular exchange among US cryptocurrency investors. It is the largest digital asset platform based in the US and offers many trading features and a streamlined user interface. Due to its user-friendly approach, Coinbase is especially popular among crypto beginners. However, the company provides an advanced version of the platform as well, called Coinbase Pro, which offers more trading functionality and access to a more extensive selection of cryptocurrencies.

About Bybit

Bybit is a relative newcomer to the crypto scene, having initially launched in 2018. The platform offers various features like spot trading, derivatives products and services, and a wide array of passive income generating features as a part of its Earn platform. Bybit has a global presence, and its easy-to-use desktop and mobile offerings are available in numerous languages. Unfortunately, Bybit doesn't offer its services to users from the United States.

Step-by-step guide

The process of sending USDT from Coinbase to Bybit is easy to follow and far from being prohibitive to those users that don’t have extensive crypto knowledge. Follow the steps provided in this guide, and you should have no problems moving your crypto holdings between exchanges.

1. Login to your Bybit account and get your USDT deposit address

First, you have to log in to your Bybit account and click on the Deposit option. Navigate to your Tether deposit address. Copy that address or scan the QR code. This is your destination address that will be used when withdrawing from Coinbase.

Make sure that you have selected the appropriate blockchain to transfer USDT on it. The selected chain must be supported by both exchanges. TRC20 is a cheap and fast option for moving Tether, and it is the most popular choice for most users.

The process for web users and app users is a little different. The first two images below show the process for web users, and the latter two are intended for app users.

The deposits will be done through the spot account. For traders who created their account before July 15, 2021, the deposit will go to the spot account and automatically rerouted to the derivatives account. For accounts created after July 15, 2021, the deposits will be available in the spot account directly. You can change your default deposit settings if you have a preferred deposit destination.

2. Withdraw USDT from Coinbase to your copied Bybit address

Log in to your Coinbase account, and choose the Send/Receive tab.

After selecting the Send/Receive tab, a pop-up will appear. Choose the Send tab on the pop-up, and enter the data into the empty fields. You have to paste your USDT deposit address from Bybit, and you must also insert the exact amount of your withdrawal. Click Send Now and you will be navigated to transaction overview.

3. The deposited USDT should be in your Bybit account

After several network confirmations that could take a up to few minutes to complete, the withdrawn USDT will be deposited to your Bybit account.

Additional considerations

Crypto traders have to transfer assets like USDT between crypto exchanges if they wish to pursue lucrative investment opportunities across different exchanges. Also, different exchanges often have support for different altcoins, which means that transferring funds is the only option to gain exposure to certain altcoins. Other features like staking, lending, and more are also different from one exchange to another.

The process of sending USDT from Coinbase to Bybit is secure as long as you are doing it according to the steps provided in the guide. Make precautionary steps regarding scams like phishing. Be cautious when you copy the deposit address. If you copy the address wrong, you won't get your withdrawn USDT. Pay close attention to the chain that you choose for the transaction--the blockchain option has to be supported by both Bybit and Coinbase exchanges, otherwise, your assets will be lost permanently.

Bottom line

The procedure of moving USDT from Coinbase to Bybit is straightforward, requiring just a bit of attention and precision. Be careful when you copy the deposit address and choose the correct blockchain before withdrawing or depositing funds. Once fully versed in the practice of transferring funds between exchanges, you will be able to take advantage of lucrative investment opportunities on various digital asset platforms. Hopefully, this guide helped you move your USDT between exchanges!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NzA1L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20tY29pbmJhc2UtdG8tYnliaXQv0gFTaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTQ3MDUvaG93LXRvLXRyYW5zZmVyLXVzZHQtZnJvbS1jb2luYmFzZS10by1ieWJpdC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-06-09,Apple WWDC 2022: Can You Mine Bitcoin on MacBook M2 Chip? - Coinspeaker,"Apple’s annual WorldWide Developers Conference (WWDC) is already here; it begins on Monday, June 6th, and runs through the 10th. In-person attendance will be limited; most participants will do so online. So, what surprises does Apple have in store for us?

Moreover, Apple’s WWDC 2022 event is entirely focused on software and developers. The new versions of Apple’s various operating systems that power its phones, tablets, watches, computers, media players, and possibly other devices should excite everyday users.

However, the main focus of crypto traders is whether the latest hardware and software changes will allow them to mine Bitcoin using the MacBook M2 Chip or IOS16. So, let us find out.

What to Expect at WWDC 2022: M2 Chip & IOS16

Apple’s WWDC 2022 event, as usual, had plenty to choose from, starting with the latest version of Apple’s iPhone operating system, iOS 16, and its latest chip, the M2, to the newest hardware.

That puts it all in (or on) your hands – in this case, the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13. One of the most prominent new features is Safety Check, which is meant to help people in danger of domestic violence.

Key Highlights of the Apple WWDC 2022 Event

At the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2022, Apple’s second major annual event, the Cupertino-based company announced a slew of new products, including a software update for its iPhones and the introduction of a buy now, pay later service.

The tech titan unveiled a new car dashboard that will be available in new models from Jaguar and Ford. In addition, Apple also released a slew of collaboration and data security features.

The following are the major product launches made at the event:

MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13

Apple has redesigned the Air for the first time in ages, with the M2 chip in mind. The new MacBook Air weighs only 2.7 pounds and is 11.3 inches thick. It has a 13.6-inch liquid Retina display and a Magsafe charging system, and a headphone jack is also included.

The MacBook Air will be available in gray, gold, silver, and blue for $1,199, whereas the MacBook Pro starts at $1,299. Both laptops will be available in the coming month. Apple continues to sell the M1 MacBook Air, which starts at $999 and includes a $100 education discount.

iOS 16: Buy Now Pay Later

iOS16, the new version of the iPhone’s operating system, emphasizes customization. That includes a refreshed lock screen with new widgets, increased personalization, and a new approach to notifications.

Further updates to the Wallet include more wireless key partners, such as car manufacturers, as has tap-to-pay on iPhone for contactless payments and Apple Pay Later.

Apple Pay Later allows users to pay with Apple Pay wherever accepted and pay in four installments over six weeks without incurring additional fees.

The iOS will include new CarPlay updates, such as new gauge clusters. Automakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Ford Motor Company will integrate the feature into their vehicles.

Bitcoin Mining: How do People Earn Money from it?

What is Bitcoin Mining?

Bitcoin mining is the process of creating fresh Bitcoins and putting them into circulation. Through Bitcoin mining, the network confirms recent transactions and is an important part of keeping the blockchain ledger up to date and making it better.

“Mining” is done with sophisticated hardware to solve a complex computational math problem. Therefore, the first computer to solve the problem receives the next block of bitcoins, and the process is restarted.

How to Earn Money with Bitcoin Mining?

The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin is a “decentralized” cryptocurrency and it does not rely on any central authority, such as a central bank or government, to oversee its regulation because many users worldwide share these responsibilities.

Bitcoin miners receive a reward, an incentive, or a profit in the form of Bitcoin. Miners help with the primary goal of mining: legitimizing and monitoring Bitcoin transactions to ensure their validity. It’s called completing the “block” of verified transactions that are later added to the blockchain.

Can You Mine Bitcoin on MacBook M2 Chip?

With the release of the Apple M2 chipset, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are eager to learn if the M2 chip can be used to mine Bitcoin.

About M2 Chipset

M2 kicks off the second generation of Apple’s M-series chips and expands on the outstanding features of M1. Apple claims that the new chip adds even more performance and capabilities to Apple’s most popular Mac notebooks, the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, thanks to industry-leading power efficiency, a unified memory architecture, and custom technologies.

This M2 chip helps to improve core processing performance by 18% over the M1 without compromising battery life in the company’s new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro laptops.

Can You Mine Bitcoin Use Apple’s M2 Chipset?

The first thing to keep in mind is that you don’t want to be mining in the background using your Macbook or any other windows laptop. The cryptocurrency mining application degrades the machine’s performance for anything else, including casual web browsing, so you should only use the mining app when you’re not using your Mac.

The Apple Macbook M1 chipset produced just over 5Mh/s (mega hash per second), which looks better when considering the total power draw of only 17W. After accounting for electricity costs, a crypto calculator reveals that the profit is only $12.82 per month or approximately 42 cents per day. So if you bought a MacBook Pro solely for mining, it would pay for itself in about 10 years.

Apple’s newly designed central processing units M2 account for the 18% speed increase. Unfortunately, mining Bitcoin using a MacBook Pro M2 chipset won’t be possible.

You will need to purchase mining hardware designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. However, most Bitcoin mining hardware is readily available on Amazon. Bitcoin mining hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), is critical.

With FPGAs and GPUs, crypto miners can increase mining power by up to 100x while using less power, saving on large electricity bills. Bitcoin mining with anything less powerful will consume more energy than you will likely earn.

Don’t worry, we’ll show you an alternative and less expensive solution to Bitcoin mining, also known as Crypto mining.

2022-05-14,What is Tether? - Cryptosrus,"Considering all the talk about stablecoins of late, it’s a good idea to check out our “What Is Tether?” guide.

Covered:

What Is Tether?

Who Created Tether?

How It Works

What Is USDT?

What is Tether?

Tether is a ‘first of its kind’ cryptocurrency, which is known as a stablecoin. This is because it aims to keep its valuations stable and free from the typical volatility of cryptocurrencies. It has been specially designed to create the necessary bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies in order to provide stability, transparency, and low transaction fees to the users. Stablecoins are designed to be pegged to a given currency, and Tether is pegged to the US dollar and maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with the US dollar in terms of its value. It is designed to be used as a means of converting cash into digital currency.

It also claims that all Tether in circulation reflects the number of their reserves in US dollars. This means that every token is backed by an actual dollar held in its reserves. The value of the token is kept stable by bots buying and selling whenever its value fluctuates. Whenever a user deposits a US dollar to Tether’s account, the company mints one Tether in return. As a result Tether’s value remains close to $1 at all times. Today Tether also supports four stablecoins; the US dollar, the Chinese Yuan (CNHT), the Euro (EURT), and the stablecoins backed by one oz of gold (XAUT).

Who Created Tether?

Tether, formerly known as Realcoin, was first launched in 2014 by Tether Limited. There is an interesting background to its development. In the early 2010s, two groups began to work on the idea that the Bitcoin blockchain could be a platform used for issuing cash. These two groups were a startup called Realcoin and the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Eventually, the two projects would merge efforts, resulting in the formation of Tether Limited. It was co-founded by Brock Pierce the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars.

The company’s aim was to make government-issued fiat currency more compatible with newer crypto assets which are traded 24/7 on an active global market. Tether is one of the earliest cryptocurrencies and to date, it remains the most successful stablecoin. Tether Limited is a company owned by Bitfinex, with its head office in Hong Kong. Tether has been designed as a stablecoin. These are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to real-life assets or commodities to ensure stability in value and lower volatility in the market.

How It Works?

Tether was originally launched and issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer protocol which is a platform used for creating and trading digital assets on top of Bitcoin. It means that this protocol allows projects to create and trade their own currencies. It also enables the minting and burning of Tether tokens based on the amount under custody. It also helps track and report the total circulation of Tethers. Tether’s ledger is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain because of Omni and the users can view their verified transactions through Omni Explorer.

Tether Limited manages its token reserves and accepts fiat deposits and withdrawals. It also mints and destroys tokens to keep the coin’s values stable. Tether Limited accepts cash deposits and withdrawals on behalf of clients and is responsible for minting and destroying Tether tokens in accordance with the reserves they administer. For example, when someone deposits $10 in their Tether account, then ten USDT coins are minted.

Stablecoins can be pegged to real-life currencies such as the US Dollar or Euro or even precious commodities such as metals. In Tether’s case, it is pegged to the US dollar. This means that according to their claims, for every USDT in existence, there is one US dollar in Tether Limited’s reserve. Similarly, Tether claims to be backed by fiat currency. It means that holders aren’t subjected to the same high levels of volatility found in other cryptocurrencies. It gives users easy access to the cryptocurrency market without exposure to wild price fluctuations. Bitcoin or Ethereum are not pegged to any real-life commodities, so many crypto traders buy Tether as a way to safeguard their financial position in case the crypto market crashes one day.

Tether is a popular cryptocurrency that can be bought and sold on most exchanges. Many exchanges use it as a trading pair which is a common way to denominate prices in fiat currency and which people readily understand.

What is USDT?

Tether tokens which were developed by the crypto exchange Bitfinex are the native tokens of the Tether Network and trade under the symbol USDT. Each USDT token is redeemable for a corresponding US dollar held under custody by Tether Limited. The total value of all USDT is said to be equal to the reserves held by the firm. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Tether isn’t mined, instead, Tether Limited generates new tokens and issues them via Bitfinex.

As of Feb 2021, it has a circulating supply of more than 83 billion. Tether has proven itself to be a useful tool for the crypto community with investors quick to buy in downturns as a way to protect themselves from the market downslides. This has made it a useful source of liquidity for the market which helps to keep prices stable. Its remittance power is another reason why it attracts so much interest because the USDT can be sent to any corner of the world and converted to US dollars, Euros, etc

Concerns

With many advantages, it also has certain cons. USDT can’t be mined and it is difficult to sell large amounts of USDT on Tether exchanges. Also, the company can complicate the procedure for buying or exchanging USDT at any time. This is because Tether is a centralized entity, and therefore the reins of the project lie in the hands of a single company instead of the wider community. Similarly, to buy or sell USDT digital coins on the company’s website, you must provide scans of documents. This can cause concern for privacy-savvy users.

Another issue is the fact that there is immense competition in the stablecoin space. While USDT is to date the largest stablecoin by market cap, other projects like UST, BUSD, and USDC are hot on its trail. There is also controversy regarding the fact that Tether claims that all USDT coins are backed by actual and real US Dollars. Critics have argued that it seems unlikely that Tether maintains a multi-billion dollar reserve of US dollars.

Where To Buy USDT

You can purchase USDT through KuCoin exchange, similar to how you would buy another cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you are willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current price and have your order filled almost immediately. If you are interested in purchasing USDT, you can do so by visiting KuCoin, Gate.io, or Binance.US.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy10ZXRoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-06-20,The Ultimate Review of Top 4 Crypto Exchanges in 2022 - Altcoin Buzz,"Centralized exchanges get a bad rap. They do. And not just from the ‘not your keys, not your coins’ crowd. That said, you should NEVER keep long-term holdings on an exchange. You should always move them to cold storage or the non-custodial private wallet of your choice.

And in case we forgot, Celsius is teaching us that lesson all over again, although they are a centralized lender and not an exchange. But does that make exchanges all bad? Of course not. So in this article, we’ll tell you about the Top 4 Crypto Exchanges nowadays.

First, they are often the best on-ramp and off-ramp to crypto from fiat money. Second, they offer lots of great services in one place for short-term trades. Sooner or later, we need one or both of these reasons to use a CEX. So let’s get set up with the best ones for the times that we need them. Want to know who is the best? Well, stay tuned.

1) MEXC Exchange

For our American viewers, you guys are going to love MEXC if you don’t know about it yet. Imagine all those services from big global Binance that you are locked out of just because you are American. And now they are open to you because MEXC offers them too. Everything from:

Trading

Futures and Options

ETFs including leverage

Margin accounts

DeFi and Staking

And more

All with the convenience of the place where you on-ramp your fiat into the crypto-economy.

Also, MEXC has lots of things we like. Some things we like specifically are:

They are licensed in the US: Our American friends can use them. Other difficult jurisdictions like Australia too.

NO KYC is required for up to 10 BTC: Yes, 10 BTC. Now every service isn’t available if you don’t KYC. But the most important ones of trading, futures, and staking ARE. So not only do Americans, and everyone else, get the major services Binance provides, but you can do so without doing KYC for quite a while. Maybe forever since 10 BTC is almost $220,000.

They have over 1300 trading pairs.

Only Gate.io has more and is restricted in many countries that MEXC is not.

MEXC has a quality token, MX: We know some of you out there like exchange tokens. After all, it is betting on market growth which seems inevitable at this point. Therefore, you can use MX to lower your trading fees, for staking and on the MEXC launchpad too. Its tokenomics are pretty solid too if you wanted to just buy it to HODL.

2) Binance

Next, we have the current king, Binance. They are the biggest crypto exchange in the world by volume. They do 4x more volume daily than the next biggest exchange. It’s amazing how fast they have grown and how much bigger they are than their competition. That volume number by the way is $28 BILLION daily.

And that volume means good prices for us, low slippage, and lots of potential services we can use. Also, Binance was one of the first and the biggest to integrate lots of related investment services in one place.

Moreover, Binance offers:

Spot Trading

Futures and Options

DeFi and Staking

Launchpad

Lending

P2P Trades

Margin Accounts

Its own Debit Card, etc.

In addition, when you search around the website, if it seems like it has almost everything a trader or investor could want, that’s because it does. And the BNB token, the native token of Binance, is the #5 value project in the crypto ecosystem. It’s only behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 2 stablecoins. However, its limitations are:

Heavy restricted in the US and some other jurisdictions.

Its inability to handle bank wires from many countries for direct fiat to crypto transfers is the major shortcoming.

And they try to handle the direct fiat to the crypto problem by enabling P2P trades and providing the escrow service.

3) Crypto.com

Now we have the rising star, Crypto.com. Crypto.com is an exchange yet it’s best known for its debit cards. It’s probably the most popular crypto debit card in the market today.

They have a full exchange but Americans can’t use it. They can only use the app. That said, the app has many more features than Binance’s American option, Binance.US. Also, something else Crypto.com and Binance has in common is both use Cosmos for their exchange coins. Binance is for BNB and Crypto.com uses CRO. Both were created on separate blockchains as part of the Cosmos network.

Moreover, Crypto.com does enable bank transfers in many markets including the US. They don’t charge a fee on their end for either an ACH or a wire transfer but your bank probably will on their end. Then the only other issue is the waiting time necessary to buy for the funds to clear. But Crypto.com’s dominant card position might be changing.

They just announced a huge update and change starting on June 1st. If you have or are interested in their debit card, you need to see this. The 2 big things are:

The card rewards are cut by a minimum of 50% across all card categories AND No more staking rewards for staking CRO as part of qualifying for a higher tier card with a cap on card reward rates at very low numbers

Needless to say, users are outraged, as you can see in the many comments on this thread. Many are immediately unstacking their CRO or even cutting up their cards.

More About Crypto.com

The rebates and use of your crypto in debit card form still apply and still maintain value for many users but you should know about these changes that are here. What we like about Crypto.com is that in all sports, but especially baseball and basketball, successful teams have utility players. A utility player is usually someone who does many things well but is not outstanding at any one thing. And that’s what Crypto.com is.

And Crypto.com is a utility player in the world of crypto exchanges. They do many things well such as access, trading pairs, and other services. They have far less access than Binance or MEXC, fewer trading pairs than MEXC, and smaller markets for spot, futures, and derivatives than either Binance or MEXC.

But they do all these things pretty well. They are ok on fees and pretty good in most other areas too. Moreover, their new NFT marketplace is something that differentiates them. And their Pay for Business and Crypto Pay programs are good too. And then there is the debit card, which is the gold standard for the industry even with reduced benefits.

Lastly, they might have the fastest-growing exchange coin of all. CRO is the #21 project by market cap valued at $3 billion. So there are lots of things to like here. If you like a little bit of everything and don’t need the biggest markets and most sophisticated trading tools then Crypto.com has lots of things to like.

4) Kucoin

KuCoin is Asia’s most popular exchange. First off, it has some of the lowest fees in the market without having to trade huge volumes to get it. Their claim right on the front of their website is that 25% of all crypto holders worldwide have a KuCoin account. And given how popular they are in Asia, we believe it.

Also, KuCoin offers many of the services Binance and MEXC do like:

Spot and Margin Trading

P2P Trading

Futures

Leveraged tokens

Lending and Borrowing

Mining

Launchpads

And NFTs

Moreover, they uniquely cater to their Asian market. Instead of using their KCS Coin or USDT for many trading pairs on the exchange, they also offer lots of pairs with NEO and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). NEO has been around since 2014 but if you remember, it was first marketed as the Chinese Ethereum. And while it’s very successful in China, most of the activity is there, and outside of Asia NEO is mostly unheard of.

That said, the many Chinese traders that use Kucoin love that they can easily exchange NEO. They have many different coin options directly without having to stop over in USDT or other stablecoin first. That’s understanding your audience. You don’t have to KYC for up to 1 BTC withdrawal per 24 hours.

More About KuCoin

In addition, many who like to use their phone number to secure their account cannot do it in KuCoin. They support 91 countries for this but that leaves lots of people out including the US. KuCoin operates in most countries, but not in the US.

We like the Asia focus for one. There seems to be more fast-growing daily crypto adoption in Asia than anywhere else. Also, KuCoin is in over 200 countries and speaks over 20 languages in their Customer Service department. That’s seriously global. They have a good selection of alts too although less than MEXC.

And yet whether it’s the lack of US market position or heavy Asia focus, even at its strong position, KuCoin has lots of room to grow. Also, its KCS token is pretty good too. In fact, you could do A LOT worse than just buying these 4 exchange tokens.

Conclusion

So that’s our look at 4 of the top exchanges in the world today. They all have good features to offer or they wouldn’t be top choices of traders and investors again and again. However, if you are Asian and want as many trading pair options as possible with Chinese coins, then KuCoin is an excellent choice.

Also, if you want the deepest order book or the most heavily funded futures market, then Binance is probably the place for you. Moreover, if you want to link your crypto account to a debit card, then Crypto.com is still the best place despite these new changes that are coming.

And lastly, if you want the best of most of these features and access to the most trading pairs, especially if you are American but even if you aren’t, then the natural choice is MEXC.

Arker announces partnership with Habbo to give players an unique way to use their NFTs

Arker, a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform built on Binance Chain, has announced a strategic partnership with Habbo. The partnership revolves around Arker: The Legend of Ohm, as players will be able to use their Habbo NFTs inside of the game.

Arker: Legend of Ohm is a game where players explore a world called Ohm with a hero and their pet. The game incorporates play-to-earn elements, rewarding players with tokens. Arker: Legend of Ohm features both PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) game modes.

The game incorporates a pair of deflationary tokens called ARKER and FoA. ARKER is the Arker platform’s governance token, and also serves as a currency to purchase in-game pets. FoA stands for Fragments of Arker and is the main currency for in-game purchases including items, character upgrades and other features. Players can earn FoA by completing quests, or successfully performing in the game’s PvE and PvP game modes.

Habbo is an online game with distinct pixel graphics where players form communities and chat with other players, design their own spaces and represent themselves with avatars. Habbo has been operating for 21 years, and the project recently made its debut in the NFT space with two NFT collections: Habbo Avatars and Habbo Portraits. The two NFT collections will become available in Arker: Legend of Ohm – players who own a Habbo NFT in their crypto wallet will be able to use it within the game.

According to the Arker team, they plan to pursue additional partnerships beyond the collaboration with Habbo. The project sees the integration of third-party NFTs as a unique feature for Arker, giving players the ability to enjoy their NFTs in multiple contexts.

Arker CEO and co-founder Juanjo Chust commented on the partnership with Habbo, saying that it expands the audience that the Arker ecosystem can reach:",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2NvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDg1Ny9wMmUtZ2FtZS1hcmtlci10aGUtbGVnZW5kLW9mLW9obS1pbnRlZ3JhdGVzLXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LW5mdHMtYXMtaXQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtaGFiYm8v0gGLAWh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0ODU3L3AyZS1nYW1lLWFya2VyLXRoZS1sZWdlbmQtb2Ytb2htLWludGVncmF0ZXMtdGhpcmQtcGFydHktbmZ0cy1hcy1pdC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1oYWJiby8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-30,"Gain 40,000 USD a Day with the Huobi Grid Trading Bot: A User Proves It Is Possible - CoinCodex","A depressed sentiment has enveloped the crypto market and the Terra collapse only served to underscore how volatile the crypto trading environment is.

Terms such as “long winter”, ""bear market"" and ""stablecoin crash"" are frequently used, while stories about making phenomenal profits appear to be a thing of the past. Many traders failed to seize their chances during the recent bull market and entered at high positions at the start of a market downturn. In a market that’s trending sideways, traders who lack professional acumen most often face difficulties with turning a profit.

A little-known fact is, markets trend sideways about 30% of the time, leaving the remaining 70% for range-bound market conditions. While most new retail users prefer to trade during trending conditions, the question arises — how can range-bound strategies be implemented so money can be made during non-trending periods?

There is a simple answer - grid trading, with the help of a bot.

Huobi Global, one of the world's leading global exchanges, unveiled a trading bot on its Huobi Global mobile app in April this year, enabling investors to automatically “buy low” and “sell high” and thereby amass substantial profits in a range-bound market.

The new grid trading bot enables traders to implement a strategy and control their positions to mitigate risk. Once parameters have been set, the system will automatically execute ""buy low"" and ""sell high"" within a set price range. It is therefore possible for users to make profits even if not actively monitoring market prices.

The Huobi grid trading bot has a concise, user-friendly trading interface. After accessing the Trading Bot function from within the mobile app, users will be able to view a ranking list based on PNL and the number of users who follow a particular strategy. Novices can simply choose the ‘copy’ function to mimic other users' strategies while veterans can click ""Customize"" to enter the bot's AI or customize modes. The AI mode enables users to set the price range while the customize mode enables more advanced parameters to be set.

User-friendly as it is, there are still numerous users who lack the know-how for implementing a grid strategy or who mistrust grid trading bots. There are still others who have profited greatly from a grid strategy with the bot’s assistance. Recently, a Huobi user topped the Most Profitable list and became the Huobi Grid Trading Bot's ""TOP 1"" user, profiting in excess of 40,000 USD a day. Read on to find out how he managed to achieve such a feat.

Going by the moniker BelarusOK.verse, the user is currently running more than 20 grid strategies, and gained considerable profit from deploying these. Trading XRP/USDT, NEXO/USDT, and LUNA/USDT pairs at the same time, the user’s highest daily profit from a single strategy stands at 9217.41 USDT.

It’s clear on the trading bot interface that the user has invested about 100,000 USDT in each strategy, with the total amount invested standing at nearly 3 million USDT. A cursory glance would show that the user easily made a profit of more than 40,000 USDT within a day. The trading page saw several hundred users clone his strategies.

Traders who have experienced the market crash on May 19 might be desperate for a tool to make money, especially during non-active hours. Traders can utilize this grid trading bot to ensure a rational trading strategy devoid of human emotion.

Ultimately both veterans and novices should always be vigilant amid challenging market conditions - consistent learning and overcoming human weaknesses are keys to success.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE1MDExL2dhaW4tNDAwMDAtdXNkLWEtZGF5LXdpdGgtdGhlLWh1b2JpLWdyaWQtdHJhZGluZy1ib3QtYS11c2VyLXByb3Zlcy1pdC1pcy1wb3NzaWJsZS_SAXlodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNTAxMS9nYWluLTQwMDAwLXVzZC1hLWRheS13aXRoLXRoZS1odW9iaS1ncmlkLXRyYWRpbmctYm90LWEtdXNlci1wcm92ZXMtaXQtaXMtcG9zc2libGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-05-31,Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai - The Express Tribune,"After the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.

Future Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV. According to Binance Pakistan’s Growth Manager Humza Khan, ""Future Fest helped bring some of the brightest minds in Pakistan together under one roof"".

Arzish took the stage explaining that as the 5th largest country in the world, Pakistan is currently housing a booming tech industry, and with a tech base as big as its current one, Pakistan cannot afford to miss out on the blockchain opportunity – especially due to its geographical closeness to Dubai which now serves as the ‘crypto capital’ of the world.

Arzish further said, “There is a future for crypto everywhere and Pakistan is the same; more than 2 million people are investing in crypto and this is happening while there’s no clarity on whether it’s legal or illegal.”

President of Pakistan Dr. Arif Alvi inaugurated Future Fest 2022 in Islamabad on 13 May; Panel Discussion on “Pakistan’s Road to Crypto” was also held at the event featuring Binance Pakistan Growth Manager Humza Khan, BitOasis VP Public Policy Samir Satchu, Kucoin Country Manager Farrukh Zaman Kayani, crypto entrepreneurs Alter Co-founder Zain Naqvi and Tayyaba Founder Bilal Bin Saqib

He lists down a number of challenges faced by Pakistan’s current crypto users since there are no formal channels to go through, “still, with so many hurdles if such a large number of people are investing in this, then there is public demand for it and the policy makers and regulators are also now trying to understand and grasp the concept of how crypto or blockchain, overall can benefit Pakistan’s economic growth.”

Arzish Azam is a the leading advocate for blockchain in Pakistan, he is the Former Adviser to the Ministry of Science and Technology on Emerging Technologies where he hosted Pakistan’s first ever Blockchain Summit inviting BSV Blockchain to Pakistan along with a meeting with the President, where the premier announced the call to form a National Blockchain Strategy.

Founding President of the BSV Blockchain Jimmy Nguyen started “Our Global BSV blockchain delegation was highly impressed by the energy and vision of Future Fest: to empower Pakistan's young generation to fulfill their and the nation's technology potential as if there are no limits upon what they can achieve.""

According to some statistics, from March 2021 – 2022, Pakistan alone has traded around $18.60 billion in cryptocurrency and has as many as 20 million users whereas registered investors in stock exchange is merely 220,000.

Arzish Azam stated in his closing remarks that since this industry has very high public demand and can help Pakistan’s economic growth, we should all figure out a way to use it for Pakistan’s benefit.

The government’s sentiment to support emerging industries was shared by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail in his keynote concluding the final session of Future Fest on 16 May called ""Roadmap to the Future"", he stated that the Government should try and stay away, let them be but not try to regulate them and certainly not try to tax them.

This session also featured a discussion between Dr Murtaza Syed – Governor (Deputy) State Bank of Pakistan; Tariq Malik – Chairman NADRA; and Imran Haleem Shaikh, COO – JS Bank, and Noman Azhar – CDO JS Bank and Head of Zindigi on how the tech industry can provide financial stability to the youth with the help of government and private sector initiatives and support.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RyaWJ1bmUuY29tLnBrL3N0b3J5LzIzNTkzNjQvZnV0dXJlLWZlc3QtZm91bmRlci1hcnppc2gtYXphbS1yZXByZXNlbnRzLXBha2lzdGFuLWF0LWJzdi1nbG9iYWwtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1jb252ZW50aW9uLWluLWR1YmFp0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjM1OTM2NC9mdXR1cmUtZmVzdC1mb3VuZGVyLWFyemlzaC1hemFtLXJlcHJlc2VudHMtcGFraXN0YW4tYXQtYnN2LWdsb2JhbC1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWNvbnZlbnRpb24taW4tZHViYWk_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-08,What is Zilliqa? - Cryptosrus,"Find out more about Zilliqa, the smart contract platform that’s solving the blockchain trilemma, in our “What Is Zilliqa” guide.

Covered:

What is Zilliqa?

Who Created Zilliqa?

How It Works?

What Is ZIL?

What is Zilliqa?

Zilliqa is a smart contract platform that is permissionless and public. Employing the use of its sharded architecture, Zilliqa is among those blockchain networks that aim to solve the blockchain trilemma. Primarily the project is focused on addressing the limitations in scalability faced by most blockchain networks. It allows multiple concurrent chains to verify and execute transactions, thus increasing the speed and overall capacity of the network.

Launched in 2017, by a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore, its founders claim that Zilliqa can have a transaction speed around a thousand times faster than Ethereum. It is one of the world’s first blockchain networks with a sharded architecture. In addition to its unique sharding mechanism, Zilliqa also employs the use of a hybrid consensus mechanism. It is a combination of Proof-of-Work (PoW), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT).

Who Created Zilliqa?

A team comprising Xinshu Dong, Yaoqi Jia, Amrit Kumar, and Prateek Saxena founded Zilliqa in 2017. All of them were researchers at the National University of Singapore at the time. The primary objective of the team was to create a product capable of processing smart contracts at scale, without compromising n core blockchain principles like decentralization. Sharding was deemed to be the appropriate technique to achieve this objective. Hence Zilliqa brings the theory of sharding into practice through its protocol in order to address the problem of scalability.

The project was incorporated in June 2017, under the name Zilliqa Research. The White Paper was released in August of the same year. Zilliqa is created using its own proprietary programming language called Scilla. In January of 2018, the source code of Zilliqa was released, and at the end of the year in November, the Final testnet was launched. The mainnet of the network was formally launched in January of 2019.

How It Works?

The most prominent feature of Zilliqa is its reliance on sharding technology to provide an answer for high congestion. To put it simply, sharding is when a network is divided into different clusters of nodes. These clusters of nodes are known as shards and they have the ability to process transactions simultaneously. Therefore, instead of the whole network processing one transaction, different shards process multiple transactions in parallel. The higher the number of shards there are in the network, the greater is its transaction speed.

One of the most common concerns with sharding technology has been the difficulty of reaching consensus. In traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin, the agreement of half the nodes is required for the verification of a transaction. Such an arrangement would be quite cumbersome on a sharded network in which the nodes are scattered across multiple shards. Luckily Zilliqa has a remedy for this problem. Its hybrid consensus mechanism delegates the verification of transactions to the shard level. This means that individual shards can not only process but also verify transactions. Furthermore, Zilliqa has added a second layer to the verification process to ensure its validity. This second layer consists of a group of nodes known as the directory service (DS) committee. The DS committee has access to the entire blockchain, and can easily confirm if verification is valid.

Zilliqa has also partnered with Chainlink to provide access to real-world data. This will be achieved through the use of Oracles. These oracles shall allow the Zilliqa smart contracts to import data from beyond their own network. Similarly, this also provides an added layer of security to the network. Since the data will be provided by multiple nodes, hence there will be no central point of attack or failure.

What is ZIL?

ZIL is the native token of the Zilliqa platform. It has several utilities in the network which include the ability to execute smart contracts, pay transaction fees, and as rewards for the miners. In the future, it is also intended to be used as a governance token. Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, the token was later swapped to the Zilliqa network after the launch of its mainnet. More than $22 million were raised in the first public sale of ZIL from December 2017 to January 2018. Only members of the Zilliqa Slack or Telegram groups who had been members before November 29, 2017, were allowed to participate in this sale.

The total supply of ZIL is capped at 21 billion. The platform periodically releases more ZIL into circulation in the form of rewards for the miners and the stakers. 40% of the total supply of ZIL has been reserved for the miners.

Concerns

The primary concern with Zilliqa is the same that is everpresent for all projects that are looking to solve the blockchain trilemma. The main problem faced by all these so-called ‘Ethereum Killers’ is the enormous level of competition. The project that emerges successfully from amongst all this competition is likely to wipe out all others. Even Ethereum itself after Ethereum 2.0 may spell the end for all these upstart projects. Another concern is that most new projects prefer Proof-of-Stake (PoS) over Proof-of-Work (PoW) citing it as much more efficient. Zilliqa uses a hybrid PoW consensus mechanism, and it remains to be seen if it will remain successful in the long term.

Where To Buy ZIL?

You can purchase ZIL through KuCoin exchange, similar to how you would buy another cryptocurrency. You can either place a market buy or a limit buy. With a limit buy, you determine the price you are willing to pay, and your order gets filled once the token price reaches your limit price. If you want to get your hands on the token quickly, you can place a market order, where you agree to pay the current price and have your order filled almost immediately. If you are interested in purchasing ZIL, you can do so by visiting KuCoin, Gate.io, or Binance.US.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc3J1cy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy16aWxsaXFhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-31,"Wallet Firm Liminal Raises $4.7M From Elevation Capital, CoinDCX, Sandeep Nailwal and Others - CoinDesk","Elevation Capital , a venture capital firm providing early-stage capital for startups in India, led the funding round.

Prominent Indian exchange CoinDCX participated in the funding, as did marquee angel investors such as Andreas Antonopoulos, Balaji Srinivasan, Sandeep Nailwal, Jaynti Kanani and Ajeet Khurana. Other investors included LD Capital, Woodstock, Nexus Ventures, Hashed, Cadenza Ventures, Vauld, Better Capital and Sparrow Capital.

Liminal was founded by Mahin Gupta, who is also one of three co-founders of Zeb Pay, a prominent Indian crypto exchange.

Liminal claims to be the first wallet architecture to provide secure multiparty computation, or MPC, and multisignature wallets, which require two or more private keys to sign for and send a transaction, to secure digital assets across different blockchains.

According to Liminal, it has eliminated manual operations by 90%, and that in one year of operation it has processed over $2.5 billion in transactions, automated transactions worth $400 million and gathered around $50 million in assets under protection.

“Rapid adoption of digital assets is going to be driven by multiple new-age crypto businesses and institutions,"" said Vaas Bhaskar, principal at Elevation Capital. ""We have been very impressed with Mahin and his team’s customer obsession and knowledge of this space.

Another investor, Balaji Srinivasan, added, ""As they say, 'not your keys, not your crypto'.

2022-05-16,"Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, MANA, MKR, ZEC, KCS - Cointelegraph","Bitcoin (BTC) has been relatively calm during the weekend as crypto traders try to rebuild the markets after the Terra LUNA debacle. With macro factors not supportive, several analysts expect the recovery to be a slow grind.

Crypto research firm Delphi Digital said in a recent report that the rally in the United States dollar index (DXY) had pushed its 14-month relative strength index “above 70 for the first time since its late 2014 to 2016 run up.”

Historically, 11 out of 14 such instances had resulted in the DXY rising about 5.7% over the following 12 months. If the inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin remains intact, that could spell trouble for crypto investors.

Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of crypto derivatives platform BitMEX, said in his latest blog post that the crypto markets “must be allowed time to heal” after the bloodbath. He said that if Bitcoin drops to $20,000 and Ether (ETH) to $1,300, he would turn into a buyer.

Although crypto markets are in a downtrend, periodic bear market rallies could offer short-term trading opportunities. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may bounce if the sentiment improves.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin attempted a strong bounce on May 13 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears are in no mood to let go of their advantage. However, a minor positive is that the bears have not been able to sustain the price below the crucial support at $28,805.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The recovery could hit a hurdle at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $31,721 and again at the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA)($33,985).

If the price turns down from either resistance, the bears will fancy their chances and try to sink the BTC/USDT pair below $26,700. If they manage to do that, the downtrend could resume. The next support on the downside is $25,000 and then $21,800.

Contrary to this assumption, if buyers drive the price above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $34,823, it will suggest that the selling pressure may be weakening. That could result in a sharp rally to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($39,626) where the bears are again expected to pose a strong challenge.

The bulls are buying the dips to the critical support at $28,805 while the bears are attempting to stall the recovery at the downtrend line. The 20-EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

If buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, it will indicate advantage to buyers. The bulls could then push the price to $32,659. A break and close above this level could clear the path for a possible rally to the 200-SMA.

Conversely, if bears pull the price below $28,805, the pair could drop to $27,700. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively because a break below it could signal the resumption of the downtrend.

MANA/USDT

Decentraland (MANA) has been in a strong downtrend for the past several days. The bulls aggressively defended the decline to $0.60 on May 12 resulting in a recovery to the 20-day EMA ($1.36).

In a downtrend, the bears sell on rallies to the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the current level, the bears will again try to retest the support at $0.60. A break and close below this level could indicate the resumption of the downtrend. The MANA/USDT pair could then extend its decline to the psychological level at $0.50.

Conversely, if bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that traders are buying on dips. That could enhance the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.94).

The strong rebound off the 0.60 level has risen above the 50-SMA. Although bears tried to pull the pair down, the bulls bought the dips to the 20-EMA. This suggests that bulls are attempting a comeback. The buyers will now attempt to push the price to the 200-SMA, which is likely to act as a strong resistance.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That could pull the price down to $0.95. If this level cracks, the pair could retest the crucial support at $0.60.

MKR/USDT

Maker (MKR) bounced off the psychological support at $1,000 on May 12 indicating that bulls are defending this level with all their might. The bulls pushed the price to the 50-day SMA ($1,754) on May 13 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows strong selling at higher levels.

MKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, a positive sign is that the bulls did not give up ground on May 13 and resumed the relief rally. The 20-day EMA ($1,440) has started to turn up and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to buyers.

The bulls will attempt to drive the price above the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, it will clear the path for a possible rally to the 200-day SMA ($2,179).

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level or the 50-day SMA, it will suggest strong selling at higher levels. The bullish momentum could weaken if bears pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA.

MKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 200-SMA has been repeatedly acting as a strong resistance but a positive sign is that the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-EMA. This suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.

If buyers sustain the price above the 200-SMA, the MKR/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $1,800 and later to $1,900. Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair could drop to the 50-SMA.

ZEC/USDT

Zcash (ZEC) has successfully held the strong support at $81 in the past few days. Although bears pulled the price below this support on May 11 and 12, they could not sustain the lower levels. This indicates strong demand from the bulls.

ZEC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ZEC/USDT pair could now rise to the 20-day EMA ($114). This level had acted as a strong hurdle during the previous pullback on May 5. Therefore, the bears will try to stall the recovery at the 20-day EMA.

If they manage to do that, the price could again drop toward the crucial support at $81. The bears will have to sustain the price below this level to start the next leg of the downtrend.

Alternatively, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to $135 where the bears may mount a strong defense. The bulls will have to push the price above the 200-day SMA ($150) to signal a potential change in trend.

ZEC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls have pushed the price above the 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart. This suggests that demand remains intact at higher levels. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that sellers may be losing their grip.

The buyers could face resistance in the zone between $108 to $116 but if they overcome this barrier, the recovery could reach $135.

On the downside, the first sign of weakness will be a break and close below $87. That could open the doors for a retest of the crucial support zone between $81 and $69. A break and close below $69 could indicate the resumption of the downtrend.

KCS/USDT

KuCoin Token (KCS) rebounded sharply off the strong support at $9 on May 12. The relief rally has risen above the first hurdle at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $12.89, which is a mild positive.

KCS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The KCS/USDT pair could next rise to the 50% retracement level at $14.95 and later rally to the critical overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA ($15.45). This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break above it could signal that the downtrend may have ended.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, the bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the crucial support at $9. If this level cracks, the pair could resume its downtrend and decline to $5 and thereafter to $4.40.

KCS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls have pushed the price to the 50-SMA indicating a strong comeback attempt. The 20-EMA has started to turn up gradually and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If bulls push the price above the 50-SMA, the pair could rally to $15. The bullish momentum could pick up further if buyers overcome this barrier. This positive view could invalidate in the short term if the price turns down from the 50-SMA and breaks below $12. The bears will then try to sink the pair to the strong support at $9.

2022-06-14,Cricket Legend AB de Villiers to Launch Blockchain-Powered Game in Partnership with Myria - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

Legendary cricket player AB de Villiers will be launching a blockchain-powered cricket game in partnership with Myria

Myria is launching an Ethereum-based layer 2 solution to improve the scalability of games that utilize blockchain

While the upcoming cricket game will feature NFTs and ""play and earn"" elements, the priority will be on creating an engaging gameplay experience

Cricket legend AB de Villiers to launch a cricket game with NFTs and ""play and earn"" features

Renowned cricketer AB de Villiers will be launching a blockchain-powered cricket game in partnership with Myria. The game is set to feature non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as tokens that players will be able to earn through gameplay.

AB de Villiers is widely regarded as one of the best players in the history of cricket. During his 15-year career in international cricket, AB de Villiers was selected as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times—only one other player (Virat Kohli) has achieved the same feat.

The legendary cricket player has teamed up with Myria to utilize their fully-featured platform for developing blockchain games.

Myria has launched an Ethereum-based layer 2 scaling solution that helps keep transactions quick and costs low for players of blockchain-powered games. The layer 2 utilizes ZK (zero-knowledge) technology, more specifically zk-STARKs. In this way, a large number of transactions on layer 2 can be bundled into a single transaction that is submitted to Ethereum’s layer 1.

Through the partnership with AB de Villiers, Myria is hoping to bring the benefits of blockchain-gaming and digital asset ownership to the highly dedicated cricket fanbase. However, Myria emphasized in its press release that the “play and earn” elements will not be the only reason why people will be excited about the game. The team says they will work to ensure that the game itself provides an experience that is engaging enough that earning tokens will not be the primary reason for playing the game.

AB de Villiers also commented on this very topic, saying that the project’s top priority is to make the game fun and exciting for cricket fans:

“The main thing is that there is no compromise. My cricket game will be fun and exciting just like a match on the field, but it will also be equitable and empower digital asset ownership. Myria shares my commitment and together we will bring new cricket experiences to my fans.”

The upcoming game from AB de Villiers and Myria will be available for the iOS and Android mobile operating systems. Myria expects the game to be launched in the second quarter of 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE1NjQxL2NyaWNrZXQtbGVnZW5kLWFiLWRlLXZpbGxpZXJzLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1ibG9ja2NoYWluLXBvd2VyZWQtZ2FtZS1pbi1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLW15cmlhL9IBgQFodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNTY0MS9jcmlja2V0LWxlZ2VuZC1hYi1kZS12aWxsaWVycy10by1sYXVuY2gtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1wb3dlcmVkLWdhbWUtaW4tcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1teXJpYS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-28,LUNA 2.0 airdrop: What centralized exchanges are currently ... - Cryptopolitan,"TLDR Binance, KuCoin, and several other crypto exchanges extend their support for LUNA 2.0 airdrop.

Terra 2.0 reveals distribution plans between pre-attack and post-attack token holders.

Holders will start getting their share of the airdrop soon, the remaining amount will be distributed after a vesting period.

After experiencing one of the most tragic crashes in the history of cryptocurrency, Terra is looking to revive itself through second life with Luna 2.0 launch. Previously, the network tried different ways of making a comeback but it was unable to do so, as both LUNA and UST lost more than 98% of their value. However, now the network has launched its new Terra blockchain.

The launch of Terra LUNA 2.0 took place today, as the first block was produced. However, it is expected that the other services and features of Luna 2.0 will be launched in the coming days or weeks. The Terra team announced the new blockchain with Chain ID PHOENIX-1. Moreover, users can list, earn rewards, and participate in governance decisions through their liquid LUNA.

Exchanges supporting LUNA airdrop

With the creation of the new blockchain, Terra aims at hitting the market strongly. However, the decentralized applications on the previous chain will have to start again on the new one. Furthermore, people have repeatedly questioned which centralized exchanges will support the LUNA 2.0 airdrop.

Nonetheless, several exchanges have issued support for this airdrop. This includes some top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, KuCoin, and FTX. Other exchanges include Bitrue, Bitfinex, GateIO, Nexo, and ByBit.

Through this airdrop, consumers will receive some of their shares instantly, and some of them later on. Also, the old LUNA is now called LUNA Classic (LUNC), and UST is renamed USTC. The holders of LUNA and UST are classified from the two snapshots of pre-attack and post-attack. According to the Terra ecosystem revival plan, the pre-attack snapshot was taken at a height of 7544910 and the post-attack snapshot was taken at a height of 7790000.

The calculation mechanism of Terra LUNA 2.0 airdrop

As per the new LUNA token distribution, a total of 1 billion tokens will be distributed. The community pool will receive 300 million tokens. Pre-attack LUNA holders will have a share of 350 million tokens. Though these tokens will be distributed according to their holding, they will also have a vesting period.

Moreover, pre-attack aUST holders will receive 100 million tokens. Post-attack LUNA holders will be allocated a total of 100 million tokens. They will also have a 70% vesting over 2 years. Lastly, post-attack UST holders will have a share of 150 million LUNA 2.0 tokens.

The ratio through which LUNA 2.0 will be distributed is also interesting. For every token they had, pre-attack aUST holders will receive 0.01827712143 LUNA 2.0 tokens. Pre-attack LUNC holders will receive the highest share. They will be airdropped 1.034735071 LUNA tokens on Terra 2.0. Post-attack UST holders and post-attack LUNA holders will get 0.02354800084 and 0.000015307927 tokens.

Every holder can calculate their share through the prescribed allocation criteria. The date of the first airdrop was May 27, as 30% of LUNA airdrop was made to pre-attack users. Holders with less than 10,000 LUNA were eligible for this airdrop. Their holding also counts any staking derivatives or deposited UST. These users will receive the remaining share over 2 years with a 6-month cliff.

In its true essence, Terra 2.0 aims to utilize the deep developer pool and the LUNA community that backed Terra Classic previously. They made Terra Classic the 2nd largest smart contract blockchain after Ethereum. Therefore, the platform aims that this community will back the new blockchain, and it will help the network in reviving and growing again.

Many projects that were built on Terra Classic will join the new blockchain. These include Nebula, Spectrum, Prism, Astroport, and RandomEarth. With the support of these platforms, the new blockchain will be able to scale its operations and attract a wider audience. Nonetheless, the holders of any of Terra Classic’s tokens are keeping a keen eye on these developments. They believe that it could compensate them at least a little for their heavy losses. However, the next few days are critical for observing whether the new blockchain succeeds in completing its targets or not.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b3BvbGl0YW4uY29tL2NlbnRyYWxpemVkLWV4Y2hhbmdlcy1sdW5hLTItMC1haXJkcm9wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-05-24,How Blockchain Technology has Transformed the Fitness Industry - CoinCodex,"Blockchain technology has been revolutionary since its introduction over a decade ago, sparking the rise of cryptocurrencies and a new financial system.

However, in recent years the effect of blockchain technology has gone beyond finance into different sectors. The advent of new concepts like NFTs, DeFi and the metaverse has introduced new potentials in different fields, including entertainment, gaming, insurance and more.

The latest sector to feel the effect of blockchain technology is the fitness industry with the recent move-to-earn trend that has emerged in recent months.

Changing the fitness industry

Currently, the fitness industry is one of the biggest globally, with more people embarking on exercises than ever before. However, the current market is designed to benefit only the fitness services providers like gyms, fitness centers etc.

Membership is usually priced annually, and most fitness service providers lock members into unfavorable conditions. Furthermore, members are not incentivized to work out beyond the quest to stay fit. As a result, unsurprisingly, more than 60% of first-time gym members stop exercising after the first three months of their membership.

Thankfully, the rise of blockchain technology has made it possible to achieve fitness goals, stay motivated and get paid to exercise. Blockchain-based fitness platforms utilize NFTs and tokens to ensure that users are incentivized to exercise within a transparent system. Here are some of the top blockchain-fitness platforms.

Global Fit Club

Global Fit Club is the first universal gym membership that pays its members to workout and has unique features. Individuals can become members by purchasing their native NFT to gain access to online and in-person gyms and services.

Members also receive discounts on services from Global Fit Club partners, including yoga classes, personal trainers, fitness equipment retailers, and more. Furthermore, the fitness services platform offers free online courses exclusive to NFT holders.

Members can earn tokens by holding the Global Fit Club NFT in their wallets and participating in move-to-earn (M2E) daily exercises. These exercises are tracked via its platform, and members can exchange these tokens for fiat money.

Unlike other M2E platforms, such as STEPN, Global Fit Club users do not need to spend vast amounts to play or deal with having to learn how to rent NFTs. The Global Fit Club has launched an improved model where NFTs within its ecosystem have real-life use cases such as discounts and free gym services along with their M2E game, all at a low cost. For a lower cost, users not only get to move to earn, but they also get real life utility out of their purchase.

One of the most promising things that The Global Fit Club has done is that they have already received a vote of confidence from top NBA players and fitness trainers, giving it an excellent reputation within the sporting community.

Genopets

Genopets is the world's first move-to-earn game that rewards players with NFTs for simply moving, walking or engaging in physical activity. The free-to-play NFT game combines information from users' steps through a mobile phone activity tracker and its blockchain-based play-to-earn economy.

Users can earn cryptocurrency by participating in real-world exercises while exploring ""Genoverse'' metaverse. Genopets has a native token called GENE that serves as a governance and staking utility. It is also used to mint in-game NFTs.

Furthermore, holders of the token have access to exclusive content and can participate in special community perks.

360Wellness

360Wellness is a community market that connects fitness enthusiasts with health professionals to promote physical activity. It is a decentralized health and wellness ecosystem that allows users to earn crypto as a reward for staying fit and healthy.

It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the DEFIT token to reward and encourage people to live a healthy lifestyle. Its move-to-earn game includes several challenges, and users participate in these activities to achieve specific goals.

Furthermore, users are rewarded for referring friends to use the platform, and the tokens can be exchanged for real money.

What the future holds

The blockchain-based fitness ecosystem continues to grow, which could lead to massive adoption of their native tokens. In addition, there are expectations that there'll be new features and products that will improve users' experience with move-to-earn games.

Platforms like The Global Fit Club, Genopets and 360Wellness are well positioned to become major players in the global fitness market.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0ODE1L2hvdy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaGFzLXRyYW5zZm9ybWVkLXRoZS1maXRuZXNzLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBZmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0ODE1L2hvdy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaGFzLXRyYW5zZm9ybWVkLXRoZS1maXRuZXNzLWluZHVzdHJ5Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Mika Honkasalo, an independent crypto researcher, joins Laura Shin of Unchained podcast to discuss what is happening with Celsius and Three Arrows Capital, the importance of having proper risk management, and the contagion effects on the industry.

2022-05-11,Crypto forensics startup Chainalysis raises $170M at $8.6B valuation - TechCrunch,"Chainalysis, a startup that provides crypto investigation and compliance services, has secured $170 million in a Series F funding round led by GIC, a sovereign wealth fund of Singapore. The company, which is known for helping law enforcement nab illicit crypto activities, saw its valuation double to $8.6 billion from its round last June.

The funding news was first reported by The Information citing a source and comes at a time when investors are scrambling to come to terms with the crypto market crash. Total crypto market capitalization has plummeted to a 10-month low, with bitcoin trading below the $30,000 mark on Monday.

Prior to this new round, the firm had raised $366 million from investors including Benchmark, Accel, Paradigm and Coatue. It opened offices in Singapore and Tokyo in 2020 to “double down” on its APAC presence, and as of today, it serves more than 750 customers including government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions and cybersecurity companies across over 70 countries.

Growth has been rosy. Over the past year, Chainalysis has more than doubled its staff to 700 employees. And more clients are paying larger checks — the number of companies that account for more than $100k in annual recurring revenue increased by 75% to 150.

Most recently, Chainalysis was credited as helping journalist Laura Shin track down the suspect behind the DAO hack in 2016 that involved a loss of $11 billion of ether.

Some investors worry the crypto crash might chill the funding craze in the space, but as of the first quarter, things were still looking bright. Cointelegraph Research showed over $14.6 billion was poured into crypto infrastructure, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and other web3 startups in Q1, which accounted for nearly half of last year’s total funding.

Indeed, we’ve seen some mega funding rounds in recent times. Singapore-based crypto trading and asset management startup Amber Group is reportedly raising a new round at a $10 billion valuation; 11 months ago it had just reached the unicorn status in a $100 million financing round.

2022-05-09,The Problem with P2E Games These Days and What’s Being Done to Fix It - CoinCodex,"P2E games are all the rage these days, and for good reason. Play-to-Earn games allow players to not only enjoy the game but to simultaneously earn an income while doing so. However, this does not mean that the P2E sector is free from its fair share of problems, as a portion of these games tend to experience issues regarding poor performance with their in-game tokens as well as various other issues.

A new era for gaming

By now, most would be aware about what cryptocurrencies are and what these digital assets, along with NFTs, blockchain technology and the metaverse, are capable of. Regarding P2E games in particular, it would seem like a novel and profitable concept on paper because it allows gamers to earn more money, but it is hardly ever as simple or straightforward. Many of these games tend to have hidden fees and conditions.

Still, the P2E space is gathering pace and popular games like The Sandbox, Gods Unchained, Splinterlands and more continue to gain momentum in 2022. Gaming and crypto enthusiasts are hopeful that this amalgamation of both worlds and their underlying technologies can continue to be a positive, supportive, innovative, and most importantly profitable endeavor for everyone involved.

What’s the problem?

The P2E concept of earning additional income is hindered if the in-game tokens don't perform well. If this happens, the overall reward for the playersdecreases, and this is even worse when the game itself isn’t even all that fun to begin with.

Another crucial issue which needs to be solved as soon as possible when it comes to the P2E sector is the entry fees. Once again, the whole concept of P2E is to be able to seamlessly earn additional income by playing a game and finishing certain tasks, objectives and campaigns, but if there are exorbitant fees which must be paid in order to play the game, then most would rather avoid it altogether. In addition, the fact that cryptocurrencies are classified as volatile assets which tend to experience drastic price changes would further exacerbate this problem because if players are already paying in order to play the P2E game, and the in-game token drops in price, then they may actually experience a loss.

Emerging P2E game developers have to make a decision based on their experiences. Either fix the tokenomics, which will result in greater rewards, or make the game so enjoyable and captivating that players would want to play anyway and the rewards serve more as an incentive.

OpiPets

OpiPets is among the first GameFi platforms which allows players to take part in P2E and stake their crypto without spending anything, which is important as one of the most common issues with the P2E sector is exorbitant entry fees. The OpiPets team highlight the game's free-to-play capabilities, which is important considering the rent-seeking and gate-keeping which has permeated some of the most popular P2E games nowadays.OpiPets aims to avoidhis by emphasizing accessibility and the game's free-to-play aspect. Users may breed, battle, acquire, and trade their OpiPet NFTs. They will also have one-of-a-kind hand-drawn characters with nearly infinite modification choices.

How is OpiPets helping?

There shall be a two-token method to support this environment. Once again, no entry fees, tokens or crypto wallet connections are necessary to participate. More often than not, linking in-game tokens to the governance token is one of the main problems influencing their performance. As a result, it may be impacted by those who do not play the game, like speculators and investors for instance.

OpiPets came up with a way to solve this. The team has therefore separated their two tokens to prevent this from happening. The OpiPets economy (utility) token is distinct from the governance token to shield the community from external speculators, whose only goal is to profit, in turn, impacting the value earned by players’ in-game activities

Moreover, both the governance token as well as the utility token are initially minted in OpiPets. Because the governance has a locked supply and isn't mintable after the fact; there will never be more than 500 million in total. The utility token, on the other hand, is mintable, but a considerable amount of the game's transaction fees are burnt to combat inflation, which is another rapidly increasing global problem. A fraction is also placed in the liquidity pool, which will offer liquidity for transactions inside the economy and prevent utility tokens from being produced at an excessive pace. Other ways that OpiPets is helping is via improved cross-functionality and a strong, supportive user-base and community.

What’s the future of P2E?

Ultimately, P2E is a novel concept which has already helped countless people worldwide earn additional income and was made even more relevant during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Many people turned to forms of profitable entertainment as a result of losing their jobs and needing to fill their time locked in-doors.

However, due to the high rate of fraudulent and misleading projects in this space, one can never be too careful when choosing the right game to play, as a popular P2E game, Axie Infinity, recently suffered a massive $600 million hack. It is hence crucial that games like OpiPets strive to not only offer great products and services but also do this in a way that is transparent, honest and genuine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NTkwL3RoZS1wcm9ibGVtLXdpdGgtcDJlLWdhbWVzLXRoZXNlLWRheXMtYW5kLXdoYXRzLWJlaW5nLWRvbmUtdG8tZml4LWl0L9IBbGh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NTkwL3RoZS1wcm9ibGVtLXdpdGgtcDJlLWdhbWVzLXRoZXNlLWRheXMtYW5kLXdoYXRzLWJlaW5nLWRvbmUtdG8tZml4LWl0Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-07-02,KuCoin CEO slams insolvency rumors citing “no plan to halt withdrawal” - Cointelegraph,"Crypto exchange KuCoin found itself at the center of discussion when a sub-community of Crypto Twitter started warning investors about an incoming ban on funds withdrawal. KuCoin CEO, Johnny Lyu, was, however, quick to dismiss the unvetted rumors before they picked up steam.

Prominent crypto figures on Twitter, including trader @KongBTC and blockchain investigator @otteroooo, requested their followers to withdraw all of their funds from the KuCoin while claiming that the exchange may soon stop all users from withdrawing funds.

WITHDRAW FROM KUCOIN RIGHT NOW



Not a drill



no time for thread



like and retweet to spread the message



otter hardly wrong in such matters



— otteroooo (@otteroooo) July 2, 2022

Rumors linked KuCoin’s intent to stop withdrawals with the Terra and 3AC collapse, which according to the warnings, led to “immense suffer” for the exchange owing to high exposure to the fallen tokens.

Be aware of FUDs!



Not sure who's spreading these sheer rumors, and what their intentions are, but #KuCoin does not have any exposure to LUNA, 3AC, Babel, etc.



No “immense suffer” from any “coin collapse”, no plan to halt withdrawal, everything on KuCoin is operating well. — Johnny_KuCoin (@lyu_johnny) July 2, 2022

While dismissing the supposed rumors through the above tweet, Lyu highlighted the company’s strong position by disclosing a recent $150 million funding, which placed the company’s valuation at $10 billion in May 2022. He also pointed out that the company is currently hiring for multiple positions, requesting investors to make their own judgment amid the ongoing FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt:

“No ‘immense suffer’ from any ‘coin collapse,’ no plan to halt withdrawal, everything on KuCoin is operating well.”

Further distancing KuCoin away from the insolvency rumors, Lyu confirmed to share the company’s 2022 H1 review report with detailed information about their operations. Finally, he sent out a warning to the people accusing KuCoin of shutting down services and creating panic among investors:

“For FUDers who intentionally spread unverified info, KuCoin reserves the right to take legal actions. Don’t FUD, BUIDL.”

2022-07-05,KuCoin Denies Rumors That It's Insolvent. What's Really Going On? - The Motley Fool,"Here's How a $10K Withdrawal From Your Bank Could Cause You Financial Problems Withdrawing money from your checking or savings account may not seem like a suspicious activity. After all, it's your money. Even if it's a large amount, like $10,000, who's to say withdrawing it would call for an investigation?Turns out, withdrawing $10,000 or more from your checking or savings will prompt your bank to file a report with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Unit (FinCEN). It sounds more serious than it actually is, but if you withdraw $10,000 frequently enough -- or worse: break up $10,000 into smaller withdrawals -- you could find yourself under legal scrutiny. To avoid any problems with FinCEN, here's what you should know.Why banks report withdrawals of $10,000 or moreEver since the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, banks have been required to report any transaction involving $10,000 or more to the federal government, whether it's a cash deposit or a withdrawal. Often, a bank's software will automatically file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) electronically for transactions that exceed $10,000, even if you're not aware of it.Though it might seem like a violation of your privacy, the Bank Secrecy Act helps the federal government track and prevent financial crimes, like money laundering. When banks fail to report large cash transactions, criminal and suspicious activities can fly under the radar. For instance, between 2004 and 2007, the bank Wachovia -- now a part of Wells Fargo -- allowed about $400 billion in drug cartel money to flow through its banks largely because it failed to report transactions to the federal government.When a $10,000 withdrawal can become a problemTo be clear, a $10,000 withdrawal isn't a criminal activity per se. In fact, FINCen likely receives so many uninteresting CTRs a day, you won't trigger suspicion through a large withdrawal alone. But there are some activities that will put greater vigilance on your bank account. The most common is called structuring.Structuring involves breaking up a large cash transaction, like a $10,000 withdrawal, into smaller parts specifically to evade the Bank Secrecy Act's reporting requirements. For instance, if you withdraw $12,000 in total from your checking account, but break it into three $4,000 withdrawals, the transaction might be seen as structuring.Of course, you could have good reasons for making a series of withdrawals totaling $10,000 or more. But if you do it frequently enough, your bank could report it as suspicious activity. Once flagged, structuring can embroil you in a legal investigation. At that point, if you're caught intentionally evading a bank's reporting requirements -- even if you're just a private person who doesn't want the government keeping tabs on your life -- you could face criminal or financial charges.How to safely (and legally) withdraw $10,000 or moreThe best way to withdraw $10,000 or more is to simply do it. Don't try to break it into smaller installments, or get smart and Venmo your friend half and have them withdraw it for you. If you don't want your activities tracked, don't do anything suspicious that will make your bank report it to FINCen.Truthfully, unless you are engaging in something illegal, you have nothing to worry about. FINCen knows large withdrawals and deposits happen everyday, and it's not concerned with legal cash flows. It's only when you behave suspiciously that you could find yourself under investigation.If you're concerned, you can always talk to your bank. Otherwise, just keep withdrawing as you normally would, and you won't run into any serious financial problems.

SNAP Benefits Will Increase in 2024. Here's How Much a Family of 4 Will Receive Are SNAP benefits enough?A monthly payment of $973 for a household of four equates to around $8 per person per day. While SNAP benefits aren't designed to cover everything, it isn't easy to feed a family on around $2.66 per person per meal. Indeed, research from the Urban Institute showed that the maximum benefits often don't cover a family's food costs. ""Amid inflation, SNAP benefits did not cover the cost of a meal in 99 percent of counties in 2022,"" said the report.The new benefit amount -- a monthly increase of $34 for a household of four -- is roughly in line with cost-of-living increases measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Its latest Consumer Price Index figures show that the cost of all items in June, 2023 was up 3% over the year before. However, inflation does not impact all aspects of life equally.The BLS data also shows that food at home increased by 5.7% year over year. The new SNAP benefits do not match this. Hypothetically, a 5.7% increase in benefits for a family of four would mean a new monthly payment of $992, rather than the planned $973.In addition, this year brought the end of the pandemic-era emergency food benefits throughout the country. According to CBPP calculations, this meant the average person received about $90 a month less in SNAP benefits. Even factoring in the increased SNAP benefit amount, many households have seen a significant drop in their food benefit amount, and the revised 2024 payments will do little to close this gap.How to make your SNAP benefits go furtherIt can take time and energy to provide healthy food for your family on a strict budget. The challenge is that in a busy household, time and energy are also limited resources. Even so, if you can carve out some time to plan your grocery-shopping trip, it can make a big difference.Here are some ways you might stretch your SNAP benefits a little:Use cash back apps and coupons: Look for cash back apps that work in stores that take your EBT card. You'll usually need to download an app and then scan your receipt after you've been to the store. Pay attention to coupons, whether in store or online as these can often carry hefty discounts.Always shop with a list: Planning your food shopping is one of the best ways to reduce costs. Even more so if you use a cash back app or coupons. Check what offers are available on items you normally buy before you go shopping. Mark the items that qualify for rewards or discounts on your list, so you don't miss them when you're shopping.Look for double up programs: There are Double Up Food Bucks or other programs in various states that essentially give you two for one on all produce at participating farmers markets and stores. It's a great way to get more fruit and vegetables for your SNAP dollars.Buy in bulk and batch cook: It isn't always easy to find the extra cash for bulk buying when you're eking out every cent. However, if you can manage it, you may be able to save both money and time. You might, for example, batch cook a stew and freeze portions for future meals.Unfortunately, food insecurity still impacts many American households. If you don't have enough money to feed your family this month, look for additional help. Find out what food pantries and soup kitchens are operating in your area on which days, and whether you'll need to present any documents.

Does Your Income Make You Upper Class, Middle Class, or Lower Class? Incomes vary widely across the United States, with some people making many times the amount that others earn. If you've ever wondered how your personal finances stack up, and what ""class"" your income officially puts you in, here's what you need to know.What income do you need to be upper, middle, or lower class?Based on 2021 data, here's what you would need to earn in order to be in each class:Lower class: This is defined as the bottom 20% of earners. Those in the lower class have an income at or below $28,007.Lower middle class: This is defined as individuals in the 20th to 40th percentile of household income. Earnings among this group are between $28,008 and $55,000Middle class: The middle class is officially those whose earnings put them in the 40th to 60th percentile of household income. The income range is $55,001 to $89,744.Upper middle class: Anyone with earnings in the 60th to 80th percentile would be considered upper middle class. Those in the upper middle class have incomes between $89,745 and $149,131.Upper class: Finally, the upper class is the top 20% of earners and they have incomes of $149,132 or higher.Take a look at these numbers and see where you fall based on your own earnings. And remember, this is a snapshot in time -- your earnings can change throughout your life, and so can your class designation.Will your success be determined by your income and class?It's probably not a surprise that those in the upper classes or in the upper middle class do have a higher net worth than those in the lower class or the lower middle class. But the disparity is greater than you might think. While the median net worth of those with incomes of $149,132 or higher is $805,400, the median net worth of those in the lower class is just $12,000.Your income impacts how easy it is for you to build wealth. If you make more money, it is easier to save it and invest it in a brokerage account where it can work for you. If you make less money, then you may struggle even to cover the necessities out of your checking account, much less to buy valuable assets that help you grow richer over time.But that doesn't mean people who don't make a lot of money can't be a financial success. A lot depends on what you do with the money you actually have, including how much you spend and how much you save.There are plenty of people who make over $100,000 a year who live paycheck to paycheck, and plenty of people with incomes that put them squarely in the lower or lower middle class who have diligently saved and grown quite wealthy over many years.Here's how you can improve your standingDon't be discouraged if you aren't in the class you hope to be. For one thing, you have opportunities to increase your income by taking the following steps:Learning new job skills: You could obtain a certification, take part in a management training program at work, or take some classes to develop skills that may help you get promoted (such as computer training courses or public speaking classes), depending on your industry.Take on a side hustle: The average side hustle brings in $483 per month, which is a good amount of extra money that could make a meaningful difference in your income.Work some extra hours: If your company allows you to work overtime, take advantage of it, as many people are paid time and a half for overtime hours.Negotiate your salary: According to Pew Research, when workers negotiated for higher pay, 28% said they received the extra money they asked for and 38% indicated they were given more than originally offered but less than their ask. Whether you are getting a new job or staying at your current job but feel you're underpaid, it doesn't hurt to make a request for more money -- especially if you can find salary data to back up the fact that others in your industry are paid more.And even if your earnings never put you in the top 20% of earners, you can still have a rich life and end up with the financial security you deserve -- especially if you prioritize saving as much as you can for as long as you can.

3 Reasons I Don't Like Aldi as Much as I Used To At some point in 2022, I discovered Aldi and began shopping there weekly. I found that I was able to save money on my grocery bill by purchasing certain produce items there. And since I happen to have an Aldi adjacent to my local Costco, it wasn't particularly out of my way.But over the past few months, I've become less enamored with Aldi. Here's why.1. The selection is just too limitedAldi -- at least near me -- is a minimally stocked grocery store. The shelves aren't loaded the way they are at my nearby ShopRite and Stop & Shop.To be fair, this was the case when I first started shopping there. But because there's just not a lot of selection, I'm generally limited to only buying a few items when I pop into Aldi.Not so long ago, I was running into Aldi for some fruit, which I usually buy there, and I needed to grab shredded cheddar cheese. Normally, I get that at Costco, but I didn't want to run next door to Costco and wait in a line for cheese alone. Unfortunately, though, Aldi didn't have the cheese I needed, so I had to make an extra stop anyway.2. The inventory is too inconsistentNot only is there a limited selection of food items I can buy at Aldi, but sometimes, I can't even find the five or six things I'm looking for. Aldi was once my go-to source for avocados, since it's an expensive purchase and Aldi tends to sell them for less than Costco (at least in my area). But the last few times I stopped at Aldi, avocados weren't in stock.And that's happened to me with other things, too. Over the past several months, I've struggled to find everything from cucumbers to strawberries at Aldi as well.3. What the store saves me on groceries, I lose via lost working hoursShopping at Aldi still has the potential to save me a little money on groceries. At a time when supermarket prices are up 3.6% on an annual basis, that helps.The problem, however, is that even though Aldi is right near Costco in my neighborhood, thereby allowing me to combine those trips, it still takes time to visit an extra supermarket. I have to find parking, wait in a checkout line, and spend time searching the shelves.While it's nice to save $2 here and $3 there, the reality is that a stop at Aldi might cost me 20 or more minutes of work -- especially when I don't manage to find the things I need. And losing out on that work time often means forgoing more than $2 or $3 of income. So from a time perspective, it's just not worth it.Shopping at Aldi could make sense for a lot of people. If you're someone with flexibility in your schedule and grocery list, and you're not so picky about the brands you bring home, then it could pay to spend the time visiting Aldi, even if you don't always manage to find all the things you need. But I've reached the point where shopping at Aldi makes less and less sense for me, so I'll most likely stop going there unless it's a one-off basis.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvYXJ0aWNsZXMva3Vjb2luLWRlbmllcy1ydW1vcnMtdGhhdC1pdHMtaW5zb2x2ZW50LXdoYXRzLXJlYWxseS1nb2luZy1vbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The price of KuCoin (KCS), native token of the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange, has tanked over the past seven days following insolvency rumors. At the time of writing, KuCoin was down 17.34% in the past week, trading for $8.75, according to CoinMarketCap.

KuCoin is the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency exchange, with a 24-hour trading volume of $928 million. Its KCS token is the No. 49 digital asset on CMC, with a market cap of $858 million.

But earlier this week, rumors started to spread on Crypto Twitter that KuCoin would halt withdrawals because it was about to go bust. KuCoin​​ CEO Johnny Lyu responded by saying that the company had no exposure to LUNA, 3AC, or Babel.

Be aware of FUDs! Not sure who's spreading these sheer rumors, and what their intentions are, but #KuCoin does not have any exposure to LUNA, 3AC, Babel, etc. No “immense suffer” from any “coin collapse”, no plan to halt withdrawal, everything on KuCoin is operating well. — Johnny_KuCoin (@lyu_johnny) July 2, 2022

“No ‘immense suffer’ from any ‘coin collapse’, no plan to halt withdrawal, everything on KuCoin is operating well,” Lyu said on Twitter, adding that “KuCoin reserves the right to take legal actions” against those spreading false rumors.

Lyu was referring to three recent meltdowns in the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Luna, the governance token of the Terra ecosystem, which saw tens of billions of dollars in value wiped out last month in the spectacular crash of the Terra ecosystem; 3AC or Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund that filed for bankruptcy last week; and crypto lending platform Babel Finance, which last month suspended redemptions and withdrawals.

All three are examples of an issue with liquidity in the crypto ecosystem right now as digital assets have plunged in price during the bear market.

Lyu also responded directly to someone who asked if KuCoin had exposure to Celsius, which is reportedly close to bankruptcy, and said: “Nope.”

Amid the crypto crash that accelerated in the first week of May, what began as rumors on Crypto Twitter have mostly proven correct, including rumors about the solvency of Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, and Celsius. Lyu insists that his exchange is doing just fine: “We are one of the few platforms that are still hiring,” he said, adding that KuCoin was “more active in the bear market” and launching new features.

KCS is actually up over the past 24 hours, as are most cryptocurrencies on Monday. But it still has the worst seven-day performance out of the major digital assets in the past week.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMDQ0MjIvcHJpY2Utb2Yta3Vjb2luLXRhbmtzLWFtaWQtZXhjaGFuZ2VzLWluc29sdmVuY3ktcnVtb3Jz0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzEwNDQyMi9wcmljZS1vZi1rdWNvaW4tdGFua3MtYW1pZC1leGNoYW5nZXMtaW5zb2x2ZW5jeS1ydW1vcnM_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-07-29,KuCoin Becomes the First Centralized Exchange to Launch NFT ... - Business Wire,"VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency exchange, has announced the launch of its NFT ETF Trading Zone on July 29. The new product aims to improve the liquidity of NFT assets and lower the investment threshold of blue-chip NFTs for over 20 million users.

The launch of the NFT ETF makes the KuCoin the first centralized crypto exchange supporting such instruments. KuCoin is also the first market player to introduce a USDT-dominated ETF product that marks particular underlying blue-chip NFT assets. The new Trading Zone will make top NFTs accessible to a broader range of investors seeking to acquire blue-chip NFTs. In partnership with Fracton Protocol, the KuCoin NFT ETF Trading Zone will first list 5 NFT ETFs covering hiBAYC, hiPUNKS, hiSAND33, hiKODA, and hiENS4 as underlying assets as a beginning.

hiBAYC is an ERC-20 token representing 1/1,000,000 ownership of the target BAYC in the BAYC Meta-Swap of the Fracton Protocol. The KuCoin NFT ETF Trading Zone will support hiBAYC token trading first, allowing users to own proportionally shared ownership of native blue-chip NFTs. In the future, KuCoin will launch more NFT ETFs in partnership with the corporate department of the Fracton Protocol.

The launch of the KuCoin NFT ETF Trading Zone gives the exchange a significant boost in its efforts of accelerating the establishment of a mature NFT market by lowering the investment threshold of high-potential and top NFTs in the crypto industry. Moreover, it also provides an exceptional trading experience with world-class liquidity, a better way to invest in top NFTs through direct purchases with USDT, instead of ETH, and without concerns about managing NFT infrastructure elements, such as OpenSea, wallets, and smart contracts.

KuCoin has long held the NFT sector in special focus, as evidenced by the launch of Wonderland in April - KuCoin’s interactive NFT launch platform for crypto and traditional games. Wonderland allows users to enjoy a seamless and centralized experience in buying, investing, and managing their in-game NFTs. The month of May saw the release of Windvane, another NFT marketplace providing NFT launchpad, NFT mint, trade, management, and many other services.

Johnny Lyu, the CEO of KuCoin, stated, “As a trading platform that is maintaining its rate of penetration in the NFT sector, KuCoin will continue to offer user-friendly products for investors, allowing them to easily participate in NFT investments. We are very excited to become the first centralized crypto exchange to support NFT ETFs that allow users to conveniently invest and trade top NFTs directly with USDT. In the future, KuCoin will keep exploring more NFT-related products for our users.”

2022-07-14,"KuCoin Exchange Oversteps 20 Million User Milestone, Announces ... - Business Wire","VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The global cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has announced that it has achieved the 20 million users landmark. The new milestone comes after the platform reported a record-high number of registered users in the first half of 2022.

Specifically, KuCoin attracted over 9.75 million new registered users in the first half of 2022, as highlighted in the KuCoin H1 2022 Report, bringing total user base numbers to over 20 million. The figures show a doubling of registered users in 7 months, as the exchange previously reported achieving the 10 million user milestone in December of 2021. The 219% user base increase in the first half of 2022 is largely attributed to the expansion of the exchange’s operations in Asia, resulting in the attraction of 5.6 million new users, a year-on-year increase of 659%. Latin America, Africa & the Middle East, and Europe showed 216%, 152%, and 142%, new user registrations respectively on a year-on-year basis.

“As KuCoin's 5th anniversary is approaching, the number of registered users surpassed 20 million, which is another milestone for us. KuCoin is growing at a high speed with the support and trust of every user regardless of market conditions. To express our gratitude to users, we will provide more innovative products and services around NFT, GameFi, and Web 3.0 to help users access the crypto world more easily,” as stated by Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin.

The main reasons for such user numbers growth are KuCoin’s globalization strategy and focus on new market penetration via better community and language support for new products and feature launches.

The addition of BRL and EUR fiat trading pairs, as well as BTC/BRL, ETH/BRL, USDT/BRL, BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR, and USDT/EUR, has contributed to the penetration of the exchange into Latin American and European markets. Coupled with new product launches that bolstered the overall ecosystem of the exchange, these factors have allowed the attraction of new users.

To mark the achievement of the new user number milestone, the exchange will be launching the KuCoin Futures Global Team Battle later in July. The First KuCoin Futures Global Team Battle with $1 million in prizes will give users the chance of winning up to $20,000 for joining. The event will also feature exclusive leader bonuses, newbie airdrops, and other rewards.

The KuCoin exchange is focusing on promoting its globalization strategy to continue making entry into key markets, such as Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, Latin America, and others. The exchange will also be making efforts to provide users with localized products while strengthening relations with local influencers, media channels, and other industry representatives to promote crypto education and the popularization of digital assets usage.

2022-07-23,"KuCoin Crash? 3 BIG Reasons why a KuCoin Collapse might Happen - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News","The year 2022 started on a bad note for the cryptocurrency market. Cryptos tanked by an average of more than 80%. Crypto projects and companies followed, like the Terra Foundation, 3 Arrows Capital, and Voyager. It seems that the effect of those collapses is still taking a heavy toll on other companies. It seems that KuCoin is one of those companies, as there are many rumors that the company has a high chance of collapsing. Why is KuCoin risky? Is a KuCoin crash going to really happen?

What is KuCoin (KCS)?

KuCoin is a global cryptocurrency exchange that has a user base of around 6 million. Traders can get a variety of offerings in trading like Spot, Margin, and Futures. This exchange offers nearly 600 cryptocurrencies supported on its platform. KCS is the native token of the KuCoin exchange. It can further decrease their trading fees and other swap charges.

Why is KuCoin risky?

When the crypto crash started to happen at the beginning of 2022, the Terra foundation failed to keep the peg on its UST stablecoin. This resulted in the crash of the Terra company, along with its LUNA coin. Everyone who invested in Terra lost significant amounts. Apparently, KuCoin happens to be the 4th largest hodler of LUNA, and an avid investor in the Terra ecosystem. Some info is surfacing that KuCoin’s loss amounts somewhere around $500,000,000.

It is no secret that most companies invest their money in other crypto projects. However, the source of the funds should be from the additional investments and reinvestments. KuCoin apparently used depositors’ money and bought into LUNA, then lost it all. We at CryptoTicker already warned about KuCoin in a previous article when we spoke about crypto companies that might collapse soon. Apparently, this is becoming more serious by the day.

3 Reasons why KuCoin is about to Collapse

There are many indicators that prove how KuCoin is not doing well. Here are 3 reasons for what’s going on.

KuCoin is failing to process more than 90% of the withdrawal request A whistleblower exposed how the company threw away depositors’ money and gambled on LUNA KuCoin is seeking large sums of investment rounds – most probably to be able to stay afloat

Despite all the above, the CEO of KuCoin denied all the above-mentioned claims in a tweet, saying that all the news that is surfacing is pure FUD. Who is in the right? Well, if you had +$10,000 sitting in KuCoin, would you leave them there?

Be aware of FUDs!



Not sure who's spreading these sheer rumors, and what their intentions are, but #KuCoin does not have any exposure to LUNA, 3AC, Babel, etc.



No “immense suffer” from any “coin collapse”, no plan to halt withdrawal, everything on KuCoin is operating well. — Johnny_KuCoin (@lyu_johnny) July 2, 2022

Despite the latest market downturn, more than 50% of India’s survey respondents intend to expand their investments in crypto in the coming six months – indicating an optimistic approach to the market, according to a report by crypto exchange KuCoin.

Data from the report shows that, in the second quarter of 2022, 54% of Indian investors were planning to invest more of their funds in crypto in the coming six months. This said, the figure was lower than the one reported in the preceding quarter when 63% of the polled expressed the same position.

Among the respondents from the second quarter of 2022, 29% said they intended to preserve their existing crypto holdings, 12% replied they planned to sell some of them, and only 5% wanted to sell all of them, according to the report.

As “of June 2022, there are roughly 115 million crypto investors in India who either currently hold crypto or have traded crypto in the past six months, which account for 15% of the Indian population aged 18 to 60,” KuCoin said.

A further 10% of Indian adults comprise crypto-curious consumers who are aiming to invest in crypto in the next six months, according to the report.

Source: KuCoin

India’s crypto landscape is dominated by young investors, with 39% of them below the age of 30. Per the report, young Indian crypto investors believe that crypto is more of a long-term investment than a hype, and about 26% of such investors plan to launch a business with the use of their crypto gains.

Furthermore, the majority of the respondents said that they invested in crypto because it is ""the future of finance,"" it ""brings high return in the long run,"" and it's ""a great source of passive income.""

Source: KuCoin

The Indian crypto market is forecast to reach some USD 241m by 2030, and its growth is not expected to be hampered by the latest fiscal decisions taken by the Indian authorities, the exchange said.

“Despite the ambiguity in regulations and extreme volatility, young Indian investors prefer to buy crypto as assets over gold,” according to KuCoin. “In April 2022, the Indian government imposed a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months, which is set to give a big boost to the digital economy.”

It is noteworthy that, at a rate of 30%, the tax on cryptoasset gains is higher than the nation's tax rate on stock trading which ranges from 0% to 15%. The government’s approach to crypto is the main reason deterring potential investors, with 33% declaring that government regulation is a source of concern when considering investing in cryptocurrencies.

Per KuCoin, the report is based on a total sample of 2,042 Indian adults aged 18 to 60. The survey respondents were polled from October 2021 to June 2022 and included 1,541 self-identifying crypto investors (who currently own crypto or have traded crypto in the past six months and will continue to trade in the coming six months) and 501 crypto-curious consumers (who were interested in investing in crypto in the coming six months).

The survey also reveals that another 17% of adults are considered to be crypto-curious and are likely to invest in cryptocurrencies over the coming six months.

In the second quarter of 2022, 31% of crypto owners in Saudi Arabia said that they would keep their crypto balance as is rather than increase their investment. Investors with lower income tended to sell off a part of their portfolios during the same period.

2022-08-04,"KCC’s first liquid staking protocol, sKCS.io, launches with KuCoin Ventures strategic investment - Cointelegraph","Singapore, Aug. 4, 2022 — The first liquid staking protocol, sKCS.io, has officially launched on KuCoin Community Chain (KCC). On the first day of launch, it revealed a strategic investment from KuCoin Ventures, the venture capital arm of KuCoin, the world’s leading digital currency trading platform.

SKCS.io is an underlying asset protocol on KCC, which is based on the staking function of KCC and takes KuCoin Token (KCS) as the asset beacon.

Staked KuCoin Token (SKCS) can be used in various decentralized finance (DeFi) products to obtain additional benefits. In other words, sKCS.io will allow users to free their liquidity while obtaining staking rewards. Security-wise, the official contract of sKCS.io has been audited by BlockSec.

SKCS.io is expected to become the next underlying DeFi protocol of KCC and promote the flow of asset value by linking the entire on-chain ecosystem. SKCS.io has been in contact with other projects in the KCC ecosystem. In the future, sKCS may be adopted by various DeFi products, such as decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. This will enable more KCS tokenholders to participate in the construction of the KCS and KCC ecosystems and further enhance the use and existence value of KCS.

Duke, CEO of sKCS.io, said, “KCS [had] a very prominent market performance in 2021. It is hard not to notice that, after coming up with the idea and product design of sKCS.io, we got in touch with KuCoin Ventures. We have reached a consensus on many key issues. Accepting investment from KuCoin Ventures and [the] KCS Management Foundation also allows us to reach a future long-term cooperation with DeFi protocol[s] on KCC [more quickly].”

As the native token of KuCoin and the core fuel of KCC, KCS itself is extremely valuable. With the launch of sKCS.io, the liquidity rate of KCS on-chain assets may further increase. Improving the composability of DeFi overall on KCC promotes the flow of assets for various protocols. At the same time, after the launch of sKCS.io, sKCS will also conduct joint activities with other protocols on KCC to bring more and more benefits to users on KCC. Stay tuned.

About sKCS.io

SKCS.io is a liquidity staking protocol for KCS on KCC. Users can stake KCS into sKCS.io and receive sKCS, which can be used to participate in other DeFi products to obtain higher returns or unstaked back to KCS at any time.

As one of the most well-known exchanges in the world,makes every effort to ensure that comprehensive security measures are set up to assist you in daily use and ensure the security of your account.In this article, we will walk you through everything you need to know about account security on KuCoin, to help you better protect your KuCoin account and thus avoid any potential security inconvenience.1.Sometimes, you may end up with a complete set of phishing emails and phishing sites, completely unexpected. In order to prevent such situations, KuCoin accounts have an anti-phishing security function.Users can set a security anti-phishing safety phrase (such as a motto, etc.) on their KuCoin account. When logging into the website or receiving an email will display in the email from KuCoin or the login window. If the safety phrase is not displayed or incorrect, it means that you are on a phishing site or have received a phishing email, then please do not proceed any further.2.This is a very effective function to help you avoid frequent hacking incidents by turning on this function on KuCoin, which can initiate the account protection mechanism. You will be logged out automatically when your login IP changes. With this feature, attackers will not be able to log in to your account with the hacking actions.3.Usually, it is recommended that your password should contain uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and even special characters to increase the security level of your password.And giving your KuCoin account a unique password different from your other accounts' passwords can strongly help to avoid the very inconvenience that when any of your accounts get hacked by accident, the hacker will not be able to get the password of your other account correspondingly and easily. And also, changing your password regularly is also a good way to protect your KuCoin account because you will never know in which way the hackers can obtain your password.Please note that to prevent potential attackers from locking you out of your account, there is a 24-hour withdrawal limitation once a password change action happens to your KuCoin account.4.Activating Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is also the priority to protect your KuCoin account and crypto-assets. KuCoin supports two types of 2FA: SMS and Google Authentication.With the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), you will not only get a ""double protection"" for your KuCoin account, but you will also get a convenient and easy step when changing your trading password or processing the withdrawal from KuCoin.5.In KuCoin, there is a security feature called Address Book which allows you to limit the wallet addresses so that it can be secure and convenient after setting your usual withdrawal addresses. For any usual withdrawal address you set in the withdrawal Address book for a certain token/coin, you give it the whitelist so that every time you withdraw to your usual address, only the trading password is required.6.We all know that there are frauds and scams happening every day in this industry from all kinds of SNS. To prevent any fraud in the name of KuCoin, we highly recommend that you can confirm an official KuCoin contact or domain by entering the telephone number, email, WeChat, Telegram, Skype, Twitter, or website address through the exclusive KuCoin Official Media Verification. 7.KYC can effectively reduce fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing, amongst other malicious activities. In KuCoin, we strongly suggest our clients complete the KYC verification. For verified accounts, the users can enjoy a higher daily withdrawal limit and participate in the Fiat-Crypto service provided by KuCoin. And also, in cases where the client forgets their credentials to access the platform or when others take over their account because of the leakage of personal information from the client-side, the verified KYC information will help the client recover their account quickly.II.In using the account, no matter how careful we are, the loss of account security information caused by some objective reasons is sometimes unavoidable. KuCoin's login password, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and trading password are the three most important security information for user accounts, so when you accidentally lose or forget the relevant password/verification code, KuCoin also provides you with complete process guidance to solve the problem. Correspondingly not over. Please refer to the following KuCoin Help Center article to better understand related solutions.Protecting privacy and security is paramountKuCoin aims to protect users’ privacy and assets from infringement.

2022-07-06,Trading Euros for Bitcoin or ETH is Now Possible on KuCoin - Cryptonews,"Trading Euros for Bitcoin or ETH is Now Possible on KuCoin

Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.

International cryptocurrency trading platform KuCoin is offering euro trading for Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and USDT from today. The announcement is part of an expansion of crypto trading in Europe.

These new trading pairs are offered on the KuCoin spot market. Users of the platform can easily convert their euros into crypto-currencies.

This is an expansion strategy: KuCoin is indeed experiencing strong growth in the European market, a growth that the platform intends to accelerate.

But beyond this territorial expansion, KuCoin has understood the importance of lowering the barrier to buying crypto-currencies with euro trading pairs. This strategy allows not only novice traders but also anyone who wants to start building a portfolio to use fiat money (FIAT) to build their first portfolio. The other crucial advantage of adding Euro trading pairs is that it simply offers a better fiat-crypto trading experience with consistent liquidity while maintaining a very high level of security.

On March 23, 2022, KuCoin launched SEPA transfers , which now makes it much easier for its European users to fund their accounts, with the wealthy even being able to deposit up to one million euros in a single transaction! Thanks to SEPA transfers, KuCoin customers can deposit euros into their crypto accounts via ""Fast Buy.""

Johnny Lyu, KuCoin's CEO, commented on the news: ""The new EUR spot trading pairs as part of the fiat-crypto service launched by KuCoin represent another important step after the addition of BRL (Brazilian Real, the currency of Brazil) a week ago. We hope that this will make the experience of our European users even more pleasant as well as that of people who prefer to use the Euro. It is very exciting to add two fiat currencies with spot trading pairs in such a short time. It also reflects KuCoin's ability to deploy its strategy this year effectively. KuCoin firmly believes that providing a bridge that securely and stably connects fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies will bring a better experience to crypto users, which is crucial for the mass adoption of crypto-assets. In the near future, KuCoin plans to support more fiat currency exchange pairs (FIAT) on the spot market, with the goal of becoming the best platform to discover the world of cryptocurrency with fiat currency for all users around the globe.""

It is thanks to these initiatives, which consist of making access to cryptocurrencies much simpler, that every day thousands of users are discovering cryptocurrencies. Europeans can now, thanks to KuCoin, take a launchpad to the cryptosphere that is as simple as it is secure.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

South Korean customers could lose access to more than a dozen crypto exchanges, as local authorities clamp down on foreign businesses who they say are operating in the country without proper registration.

Some 16 unregistered providers have been identified as offering services to Koreans without registering with the right authorities, a press release issued by the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) said on Thursday.

An intelligence unit of the FSC has reported the platforms to the country’s investigative authority, and asked that domestic access to their websites be blocked.

The exchanges in question were named as KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, XT.com, Bitrue, ZB.com, Bitglobal, CoinW, CoinEX, AAX, ZoomEX, Poloniex, BTCEX, BTCC, DigiFinex, and Pionex.

According to the FSC, they were found to be targeting Korean customers with Korean-language websites, and by holding promotions targeting local consumers.

The authority warned that unregistered exchanges lacked protections such as certified information security management systems, which are required under Korean law. This, they said, could leave them open to security breaches.

The penalty for operating illegal business activities of unregistered entities in South Korea is up to five years in prison, or a maximum fine of 50 million Korean won ($38,000).

Intelligence units in the respective home countries of the providers will also be informed.

South Korea's tougher line on crypto

South Korean authorities have increased oversight of the crypto market in recent months, especially in the wake of the collapse of Terraform Labs' TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its native token LUNA.

Last month, raids were carried out on the offices of local exchanges including Upbit and Bithumb, as part of an investigation into whether TerraLabs CEO Do Kwon intentionally caused the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. TerreLabs co-founder Daniel Shin’s home was also raided.

Meanwhile an investigation has been opened into illegal foreign remittances centered on Korea’s so-called “Kimchi premium” on Bitcoin prices.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMDc3MTEvc291dGgta29yZWEtdG8tYmxvY2sta3Vjb2luLXBvbG9uaWV4LWluLWNyYWNrZG93bi1vbi11bnJlZ2lzdGVyZWQtY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlc9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMDc3MTEvc291dGgta29yZWEtdG8tYmxvY2sta3Vjb2luLXBvbG9uaWV4LWluLWNyYWNrZG93bi1vbi11bnJlZ2lzdGVyZWQtY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlcz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-07-15,"Torches, the lending protocol on KCC, opens TOP Mining with up to 900% mining rates - Cointelegraph","Singapore, July 15, 2022 — Torches Finance, the decentralized lending protocol, announces the official launch of TOP — Torches (TOR) token Points — Mining. By participating in the supply-and-borrow feature, users will be able to obtain TOP rewards, which can be exchanged for TOR tokens with a certain coefficient before the TOR token launches.

Built on the KuCoin Community Chain (KCC), Torches grew to the top lending protocol with its total market size at more than $3 million. Starting from July 15 at 10 am UTC, Torches allows users to get TOP rewards for supplying or borrowing crypto assets available on the platform. In addition, Torches will open burning and boosting periods from July 18, and users can boost the mining rate up to 900% by burning Torchlight, the Genesis nonfungible token (NFT) collection of Torches Finance, within the specified time. Different Torchlight rarities have different TOP Mining-boosting buffs. Currently, Torchlight can be traded on the MojitoSwap NFT Marketplace.

With its rapid growth, Torches achieved one significant milestone after another. On July 8, Torches announced a strategic investment by KuCoin Ventures, the leading investment arm of the global crypto exchange KuCoin. Then, it developed a strategic partnership with KuCoin Wallet on July 9. Torches, the top lending protocol deeply incubated by KCC, will receive multiple resources from KCC, including products, market, liquidity support and more. As the infrastructure of KCC, Torches is expected to further cooperate with KCC in the future to improve users’ asset utilization and enrich the on-chain decentralizd finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Eric Spark, chief media officer of Torches said, “We are honored to have received the support of KuCoin Ventures and KCC in the early stages. As the infrastructure of KCC, Torches is committed to being the most convenient and popular lending protocol on KCC and even in the whole decentralized world. In addition to exploring technology and products, we also hope to bring users a better on-chain experience through various activities. TOP Mining is not only an incentive for Torches’ liquidity providers in the early stages [but] it also allows more users to enjoy the seamless crypto lending experience that Torches offers. By improving users’ asset utilization and enriching their crypto investment options, Torches will open the door of a decentralized world for more users and accelerate the development of the KCC ecosystem.”

Currently, the smart contract on Torches has been audited by PeckShield, and both parties have made multiple optimizations on smart contract permissions, oracle mechanisms and operation logic. With the release of a series of operational activities such as TOP Mining, Torches will significantly increase its market exposure and share and is expected to become the first phenomenal DeFi project on KCC.

2022-07-27,Dive Into the Newly Listed Tokens on KuCoin: Lido DAO (LDO) - CoinCodex,"KuCoin recently listed a wide range of new coins in July, but one of the more recent and exciting listings was Lido DAO (LDO).

Create KuCoin Account

Lido is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum and other assets, allowing users to stake ETH with no minimum deposit while retaining the ability to participate in on-chain activities like lending and borrowing.

What is Lido DAO?

Image source: Lido

Lido DAO aims to simplify and secure asset staking across multiple platforms. It is a liquid staking solution for ETH backed by top-tier industry staking providers.

Typically, initial ETH staking providers caused illiquidity for ETH holders as their staked assets were not usable once deposited. All holders could do was watch their assets make a return for them without being able to utilize the ETH further.

Lido seeks to provide a solution to this problem through its minted 1:1 token derivatives. Staked assets, such as Ethereum, are on the platform mint stETH, a token representing staked ETH in Lido. It combines the value of the initial deposit with any staking rewards.

So far, the project has already managed to attract $6.6 billion worth of staked assets through 146,000 stakers. In total, Lido has rewarded $169 million to stakers.

Lido is a multi-chain platform that supports staking for Ethereum, Solana, Kusama, Polygon, Polkadot, and Terra Classic.

How Does Lido DAO Work?

It works by allowing users to come and stake their assets on the platform for daily staking rewards. There are no minimum deposits, so users can stake any value. After staking, you mint staked tokens that are pegged 1:1 to your initial stake.

These staked tokens can then be used across the decentralized finance (DeFi) DeFi industry, just as you would use the normal token. In addition, Lido allows you to use your staked assets to gain additional yield.

The Lido DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that builds liquid staking services and votes on future proposals for the Lido ecosystem.

The project has already been audited by Quantstamp, MixBytes, and SigmaPrime.

What is $LDO?

LDO is the Ethereum-based governance token for Lido DAO. The DAO governs a set of liquidity staking protocols and decides on parameters such as fees. The DAO has to execute protocol upgrades to ensure the safety and stability of the network. The LDO tokens provide voting rights to all governance proposals.

Buy $LDO on KuCoin

LDO surged by over 100% in the past month, with the main reason behind the explosion being due to the highly anticipated launch of Ethereum 2.0 and the highlighted benefits that Lido will receive from it.

Recently, Ethereum developers announced that the long-awaited Merge event can now be expected to go ahead on September 19. After the news hit, LDO surged by an immediate 25% and continued to climb in the following days, as it serves as a governance token at Lido, which has 4.1 million ETH locked in a staking contract.

Furthermore, Lido also recently announced their expansion plans for the project on Layer-2, starting with expanding stETH across the L2 Defi ecosystem.

$LDO Analysis

LDO is currently ranked in the 64th position, holding a market cap value of around $775 billion. LDO is still relatively young after launching in January 2021 but managed to reach a total market cap value of almost $1.5 billion during its peak.

The cryptocurrency is now down by a total of around 78% from the all-time high price of $7.30 seen in August 2021 - providing an excellent opportunity to get in on a working protocol at a heavily discounted value.

Long-term analysis

Image source: TradingView

Looking at the daily chart above, we can see that LDO has been falling aggressively since April 2022, like the overall entire cryptocurrency market. $LDO had surged as high as $5.24 at the start of April 2022 but quickly rolled over and started to plummet.

During the summer-2022 market capitulation, $LDO went on to tank as it broke beneath $1.00 and reached as low as $0.5 during June 2022. The coin has since managed to reverse in July 2022, following the ETH 2 merge event announcement and the listing on KuCoin.

It has now managed to climb back above $1.50 as it currently sits at the 100-day MA level.

The following short-term analysis provides a better outlook on the coin’s potential in the coming weeks.

Short-term Analysis

Image source: TradingView

Looking at the shorter-term chart above, the first level of resistance lies at $1.75. This is directly followed by resistance at $2.00. If the buyers can continue to drive $LDO beyond $2, the first level of higher resistance is expected at $2.25, provided by a bearish .382 Fib Retracement level.

Additional resistance then lies at $2.34 (1.272 Fib Extension), $2.57 (1.414 Fib Extension), and $2.81 (beraish .5 Fib Retracement).

If the buying momentum continues to drive $LDO beyond $3, higher resistance can then be expected at $3.37 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement), $3.50, and $4.00.

On the other side, if the bears regroup and provide a short-term retracement for $LDO, great areas of support are expected at $1.50 (100-day MA), $1.35 (.236 Fib Retracement), $1.18 (.5 Fib Retracement), $1.00 (.618 Fib Retracement & 21-day MA), and $0.75.

Taking things further beyond the short-term again, resistance above $4.00 lies at $4.50, $5.00, $5.20 (April 2022 highs), $5.60 (1.272 Fib Extension), $6.00, $6.10 (1.414 Fib Extension), $6.50, and $6.80 (1.618 Fib Extension).

Why is KuCoin the go-to platform for trading and investing in this token?

2022-07-11,"Chronoly.io Investors Make Big Gains in 2022, KuCoin (KCS) And The Sandbox (SAND) Holders Start To Pile In - Guardian Nigeria","Investors in the cryptocurrency market are looking for coins that can rebound in the second half with KuCoin (KCS) and The Sandbox (SAND) having strong potential for gains. KuCoin saw growing demand for its exchange ahead of the recent market dump and that trend will likely continue. The Sandbox is looking to become the ‘Manhattan of the metaverse’ and investors could get in early for the next metaverse pump.

A better investment for investors could be in Chronoly.io (CRNO). A decentralized platform that is bringing luxury watch investing to the blockchain. That will appeal to traditional investors, and crypto enthusiasts will see appeal in things like staking and the fact you can trade NFTs that are 100% backed by the physical watch.

KuCoin (KCS) Will See a Return to User Uptrend

KuCoin saw a strong boost from new users on the exchange in the first quarter of 2022 and then the bear market hit. The project’s CEO Johnny Lyu has said that the bear market is temporary and KuCoin can benefit from a return to growth. KuCoin is about to embark on a buyback of tokens to cut its coin supply by half. That will increase the value of each token and KuCoin is also set to threaten the other platforms with its daily bonus for holders of over 6 KCS tokens.

The Sandbox (SAND) Can Benefit from Metaverse Growth

The Sandbox (SAND) can benefit from growth in the metaverse, and the project’s CEO has said that he wants the platform to be the ‘Manhattan’ of the metaverse. There will be stiff competition for that title, but the founder also stated that despite seeing many bear trends in crypto, he is focused on building in the metaverse. More building means more potential and a bigger lead in the metaverse virtual space. The first bull run in the Sandbox native token SAND was driven by the Facebook transition to metaverse and will also likely catch the next bullish move.

Chronoly.io is Ready to Ride its Own Bull Wave

Chronoly.io is a new project set to be launched and it has the opportunity to ride its own bull wave. The project is set to be unique and will operate initially with no competition. A decentralized marketplace for luxury watch investing and authentication will bring a trusted investment to the crypto world with asset-backed NFTs. The luxury pre-owned watch market has gained more than 30% this year as investors chased tangible assets with soaring inflation. Chronoly.io will now bring that to the blockchain and fractional investment will help retail investors to get involved.

The watch investment market, like fine art or wine, has usually been reserved for the wealthy due to the high price tags and the need for intermediaries and issues such as delivery and storage to factor in. Chronoly.io will remove those issues with its trading platform and asset-backed NFTs. Pricing will be more transparent and verification will be provided by the blockchain for added security. Chronoly stores the physical version of the watches in a fully-insured depositary and the project has also been audited.

All this has made the Chronoly (CRNO) token to rally over 660% in the last couple of weeks. Analysts expect the token to skyrocket once it closes its public presale. Experts are talking of a price target between $0.4 and $0.75.

2022-07-13,Survey reveals high penetration and adoption of crypto in Saudi Arabia - Cointelegraph,"The high degree of penetration and adoption of crypto in Saudi Arabia makes it an important market for digital currencies, demonstrating the potential for expansion in the Middle East and North (MENA) region.

According to a survey conducted by crypto exchange KuCoin, around 3 million Saudi Arabians (or 14% of the adult population aged 18 to 60) have become crypto investors who, as of May 2022, either currently own cryptocurrencies or have traded in the past six months.

Another 17% of respondents are labeled crypto-curious and are likely to invest in cryptocurrencies in the next six months. As per the study's findings, there is a long-term interest among potential crypto investors in the Arab nation. In the first quarter of 2022, 49% of crypto investors intended to increase their investment in cryptocurrencies over the next six months.

In the second quarter of 2022, investor sentiment shifted toward more conservative cryptocurrency investment techniques as the bearish market began. Thirty-one percent of crypto owners in Saudi Arabia said they would keep their crypto balance as is rather than expand it. During the same period, investors with lower incomes sold off a portion of their holdings, per the survey.

In Saudi Arabia, the high number of new market entrants is unprecedented, with 76% of crypto investors having less than one year of expertise in the sector, including 49% who first began trading cryptocurrencies in the previous six months.

Per the report, in terms of demographics, 63% of crypto investors are men. The gender ratio has remained consistent throughout the years. Young crypto investors under the age of 30 account for at least a third of the entire population and have risen to 37% in Q2 2022.

Half of the crypto investors purchase digital currencies using fiat and engage in spot trading on a monthly basis, which is the only form of crypto trading that some Arab theologians consider halal. As reported by Cointelegraph, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) fueled excitement among cryptocurrency followers last year after investing $5 million in blockchain-based oil trading firm Vakt. While this initiative sought to digitize and automate post-trade processing, it was also reported that Saudi Aramco would begin Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations.

With Web3 being a strategic focus, KuCoin conducted this global survey to understand how people think about Web3 as a career option. The findings of our “Journey into Web3” survey reveals the bright Web3 future in India with heightened interests from a diversified talent pool. We’re optimistic to see more women-led communities in the near future which will boost the comprehensive Web3 ecosystem in India.”Commenting on the survey, Medha B Dey Roy, Head of Branding, KuCoin India, said: “As per our survey findings, Indian youth have huge potential in disrupting the Web3 space. However, we noticed that there are fewer women-led Web3 communities as compared to male. The survey also shows that many women are hesitant to engage in Web3 due to perceived limited access to related educational resources and potential stress from the fast-paced industry.”“The good part is, women are recognized for their talents in building trust in workplaces and communities, further promoting diversity and inclusiveness, which is key to facilitating Web3 culture. This translates that women are more recognized for their transparent, empathetic leadership style and long-term mind-sets. These skill sets are crucial and play an important role in building a stronger Web3 ecosystem. Thus, we’re looking forward to welcoming more women to come in and disrupt the Web3 space.” she added.In this survey, Web3-related industries include cryptocurrency, metaverse, NFT, DAO, DeFi, Dapp development, blockchain-based gaming, and DAO and the Web3 Professionals are defined as those who have worked in Web3 industries, whether full-time, part-time or freelance by project base. The 34% of surveyed Indians are professionals who have worked in Web3-related sectors. The survey respondents were polled from June 20th to July 3rd, 2022, and the responses were collected via KuCoin’s social media (Twitter and LinkedIn). No quota on geography, gender, age, or income was set.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3BhbmFjaGUvaW5kaWFucy1kcmVhbS1vZi1hLXdlYjMtY2FyZWVyLWEtbWFqb3JpdHktb2Ytd29ya2luZy1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxzLWFyZS11bmRlci0zMC15ZWFycy1vZi1hZ2UvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTMyOTg0NzkuY21z0gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvcGFuYWNoZS9pbmRpYW5zLWRyZWFtLW9mLWEtd2ViMy1jYXJlZXItYS1tYWpvcml0eS1vZi13b3JraW5nLXByb2Zlc3Npb25hbHMtYXJlLXVuZGVyLTMwLXllYXJzLW9mLWFnZS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTMyOTg0NzkuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-25,16 overseas crypto exchanges engage in illegal sales activities in Korea - koreatimes,"The Korean website of MEXC, one of the largest crypto exchanges in China / Screenshot from MEXC



By Lee Min-hyung



Overseas cryptocurrency exchanges are engaging in illegal sales activities here without reporting their businesses to financial watchdogs.



According to the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, a total of 16 foreign crypto exchanges _ such as MEXC and KuCoin _ have allegedly violated the Financial Information Act by continuously operating their businesses without meeting the requirements to do so under the legal framework.



Last year, the Financial Services Commission urged a group of 27 overseas exchanges to report their business before the act was to take effect on Sept. 25. The authority also notified them that they are not allowed to run their businesses unless they obide by the regulation.



Some of them _ such as Binance _ closed down their Korean business in line with the regulatory guidelines. But another 16 exchanges turned out to continue generating profits here without doing so, according to the intelligence unit.



The authority requested the Korea Communications Commission to block access to their websites and mobile apps in Korea. The commission will hold an internal discussion and decide whether to accept the request. It remains to be seen when the final decision will be made, but it will take at least a couple of weeks, during which period, the exchanges can continue operating their trading platforms here.



Industry officials said that authorities should take stern measures against such illegal business activities, as the situation raises claims that local exchanges that do abide by the guidelines are at a disadvantage.



""Most local crypto exchange operators team up with the government to build a more reliable crypto ecosystem, even if specific legal frameworks have not been introduced so far,"" an industry source said. ""We expect the authorities to come up with specific measures to root out illegal activities for the healthy growth of the industry.""

2022-07-11,Top 7 Crypto Hacks That Shook The Digital World - DataDrivenInvestor,"Top 7 Crypto Hacks That Shook The Digital World Dwarf AI · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 5 min read · Jul 11, 2022 -- 2 Listen Share

Although cryptocurrency is renowned for its openness, it is also generally known that hackers target platforms and exchanges in order to take advantage of them. Even if exchanges make some investments to safeguard their assets, skilled attackers can get past their defences.

Exchanges are frequently targeted because they frequently contain open-source code libraries. Since a single breach might result in the theft of the assets of thousands of customers, criminals frequently target cryptocurrency exchanges. Since illegal actions are becoming more complex, additional security measures are required.

We’ll look at 7 biggest cryptocurrency thefts from this year in the sections below:

1. BINANCE: 2019’s greatest name to be hit

One of the most well-known brands in the industry is Binance. The Cayman Islands-based exchange is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world (by volume). More than 360 distinct cryptocurrencies are available on the exchange, which operates in more than 1200 markets.

Binance also asserts that it has created a complete ecosystem for cryptocurrency trading, research, education, and philanthropy. The exchange, however, experienced a significant security problem in May 2019.

2. KuCoin 2020 — The most recent assault

Singapore is home to the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. It was established in 2013 and trades in a number of cryptocurrencies, including Ardor, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. It was attacked in September 2020, and thieves were able to take about $281 million worth of coins and tokens.

In addition, several of the most popular wallets on the market had their keys stolen by hackers. Even though KuCoin swiftly disabled all online transactions, the harm had already been done. One of the biggest breaches in the history of crypto assets is this one.

3. Mt. Gox (2011) — The first significant hack in the cryptocurrency industry

Mt. Gox was a cryptocurrency exchange based in Tokyo, Japan, that was established in 2010. It formerly held the title of largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, processing more than 70% of all worldwide bitcoin transactions. The exchange was hacked in 2011 and bitcoin worth $8.75 million was taken.

The exchange promised to strengthen its security measures, but in 2014 it experienced another attack. It was done this time on a much bigger scale. Aproximately 850,000 bitcoins ($615 million) were stolen. They did this by pouring a lot of bogus bitcoins into the exchange. One of the first significant security breaches in the bitcoin realm was this one

4. Upbit (2019) — The hack which utilised a single transaction

A cryptocurrency exchange called Upbit was established in 2017. Despite having its origins in South Korea, the trade has gained popularity around the world. In terms of daily transactions, it actually overtook Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in 2018.

However, a significant cyberattack targeted the exchange in November 2019. In only one transaction, the thieves broke into the exchange and stole more than $45 million.

5. Bitfinex hack (2016): The distribution of losses

In 2012, Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange with headquarters in Hong Kong, was established. It is controlled by iFinex Inc., a business that also created the stablecoin Tether. Hackers broke into the cryptocurrency exchange in 2016 and stole coins worth more than $60 million.

Following the hack, Bitfinex was able to locate some assets and provide its clients equity reimbursements. Each user suffered an equal share of the attack’s losses.

The US authorities was able to recover part of the money in 2019 while also identifying some of the hackers. It was discovered that the attack was carried out by two Israeli brothers. Authorities quickly detained them and accused them with violating cybercrime laws.

6. Cryptopia 2019: The strange case of two attacks

Image source -Cryptopians

The Christchurch-based exchange Cryptopia was established in 2014 and is situated in New Zealand. The exchange suffered a significant attack in January 2019 that caused overall losses of $15.5m. The management calculated that the attack had resulted in the theft of more than 9% of its overall holdings. The attack was so serious that the exchange had to be completely liquidated as a result.

7. ZAIF (2018) — The attack that was discovered too late

One of the first cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan is Zaif. It was the first exchange in Japan to obtain a formal license and has been in operation since 2014. More than 40 cryptocurrencies are available on Zaif. The exchange had a significant breach in September 2018 when hackers obtained access to its hot wallets.

Even though the hack was carried out on September 14, Zaif wasn’t able to recognise it until three days later. Losses totalled over $60 million. After examining all Zaif withdrawal transactions, Crystal was able to track the money and designate the hackers’ wallet with a risk score of 100per centt.

The exchange then struck a contract with the Japanese investment company Fisco. It was able to raise around $44.5 million as part of the acquisition. The damages incurred by its consumers were subsequently compensated for usingthis moneyy. In exchange, Fisco acquired control of the exchange on a majority basis. As a consequence, the exchange’s deposit and withdrawal capabilities were reinstated in April 2019.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaXVtLmRhdGFkcml2ZW5pbnZlc3Rvci5jb20vdG9wLTctY3J5cHRvLWhhY2tzLXRoYXQtc2hvb2stdGhlLWRpZ2l0YWwtd29ybGQtN2FjOTA1YjVkOTE00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-07-14,"KuCoin hits 20M client milestone, records 219% increase y/y - CoinJournal","World-leading cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has reached an important milestone: it now has 20 million users. This achievement comes after the exchange reported a record-high number of new users in the first half of this year, Coin Journal learned from a press release.

9.75M newly registered users

KuCoin attracted over 9.75 million newly registered users in the first half of this year, with which it now has more than 20 million customers. This is a 219% increase in the user base y/y, mainly attributed to the exchange’s expansion in Asia.

The number for Asia is 659%, corresponding to 5.6 million new users.

KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu commented:

In anticipation of KuCoin’s fifth anniversary, we achieved a new milestone: the number of registered users surpassed 20 million. To express our gratitude to users, we will provide more novel services and products around Web3, NFT, and GameFi to help users access the crypto world more easily.

Better language and community support

The primary reason for the growth is KuCoin’s focus on new markets and globalization strategy via better language and community support for new features and product launches.

The exchange penetrated European and Latin American markets with the addition of BRL and EUR fiat trading pairs and USDT/BRL, BTC/EUR, BTC/BRL, ETH/BRL, ETH/EUR, and USDT/EUR.

These approaches attracted new users in combination with new product launches that bolstered the exchange’s overall ecosystem.

KuCoin Global Team Battle boasts a $1M prize fund

KuCoin has scheduled the Futures Global Team Battle later this month to mark the achievement of the new user number milestone.

The event, which has a $1 million prize fund, comes with eligibility to win up to $20,000 for joining. It will feature newbie airdrops, exclusive leader bonuses, and other rewards.

Promoting global reach

KuCoin is focused on entry into key markets, such as the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, South Asia, Africa, and others. The exchange will also try to strengthen relations with local media and influencers by offering users localized products.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmpvdXJuYWwubmV0L25ld3Mva3Vjb2luLWhpdHMtMjBtLWN1c3RvbWVyLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1yZWNvcmRzLTIxOS11c2VyLWluY3JlYXNlLXkteS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-07-03,Inheritance: An important issue not many Crypto HODLers are giving ... - The Rude Baguette,"There’s now a popular observation in the Crypto space that several Crypto HODLers and traders aren’t paying attention to inheritance and death, partly because they’re mostly young.

It’s but a few that have mapped out an inheritance plan to ensure their loved ones could access their assets after death.

According to kuCoin CEO Jonny Lyu, “Crypto inheritance is still poorly understood because most Crypto HODLers are young, and as such aren’t thinking about their death and inheritance.”

Lyu added, “This can be managed through private keys in a cold wallet that’s often stored in a safe and held with a notary.”

Meanwhile, about 4 million Bitcoins have been lost and lying idle in unaccessible wallets. In fact, a huge portion of the Bitcoin belongs to HODLers who have died without sharing their wallet access with anyone.

Simply put, without a plan to transfer your private keys, your Crypto assets would be useless to your loved ones.

Some believe that over 1 million Bitcoins owned by Satoshi Nakamoto haven’t been touched because no one could access them.

The importance of HODLers sharing private keys with loved ones

Cryptocurrencies are created for self-determination. They offer the owners full control of their assets.

Cryptos like Bitcoins puts owners’ wealth right in their hands with no intermediaries. Crypto assets are stored on the blockchain and visible to anybody with the public key.

The private keys, a long string of characters, act like passwords. The entity or person controlling the private keys controls the Crypto.

They can’t be recovered when you forget or lose your private keys.

To be on the safer side, it’s important to tell your loved one your password. Most wallets have a 12 or 24-word recovery sentence which serves as a readable representation of the private key.

Meanwhile, giving your loved ones your private keys or passwords can be dicey. If your loved ones couldn’t find your Crypto private keys after you die, they can’t access them.

On the other hand, if you share your password with them while still alive, they might steal your crypto before you even die. It’s a dilemma!

Against this, Jonny Lyu gave his opinion, “If HODLers doesn’t want to transfer the Crypto before dying, then he needs to think of drawing up a will and an inventory of the contents necessary for their heirs to open the wallet.”

The CEO added that holders who wish to transfer their assets must solve the challenge of maintaining anonymity until their heirs can come for any claims. However, he conceded that sharing access credentials can compromise the anonymity or safety of holders.

Making plans

Some Crypto HODLers have had their means of ensuring their heirs assume ownership of their assets at the right time.

Some write down the private keys, wallet addresses, or/and seed phrases on paper and lock them up in secret lockers.

Paper wallets are widely used, but they can be mistakenly thrown away like trash when seen years later.

Other HODLers turn to blockchain solutions like Serenity Shield for safety. The Shield permits users to design an inheritance StrongBox, a virtual safe, via the encrypted and entirely decentralized solution.

StrongBox functions as a Crypto inheritance and insurance against private key loss.

Serenity Shield users can configure their StrongBox with sensitive details before it’s encrypted and divided into three special NFTs securely stored on Secret Network blockchain.

How it works;

The NFT will remain with the user’s account.

The NFT would be sent to the designated heir.

NFT would be kept safely in the Serenity Shield Smart Contract Vault.

The account owner or the heir will need a minimum of 2 NFTs to crack the StrongBox. The Serenity Shield Smart Contract would only send the third NFT to the heir if the StrongBox Activation Policy defined is met.

Users can claim the 3rd NFT to cancel or change the StrongBox terms or restore the information.

In the same vein, centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase are equally becoming more popular.

For example, Coinbase allows a family member to access a dead loved one’s account after presenting essential documents like a death certificate and last will.

However, the exchanges won’t allow you to have direct ownership of your coins. In other words, you won’t have access to your private keys.

This can become risky as some centralized exchanges have folded or hacked. These popular centralized exchanges have witnessed hacking events; Binance in 2019, the infamous MtGox in 2014, KuCoin in 2020, and Bitfinex in 2016.

In addition, you can use hardware and software wallets to secure your digital assets. Software wallets are easy and free to use. They offer a 12 or 24-word seed phrase to have remote wallet access and recovery.

Several users store their seed phrases in IoT devices or emails, thereby increasing hacking risks. Hardware wallets can have the same risk, the seed phase being lost.

Final say

Following the rising acceptance of Crypto investment and the urge for self-custody, it’s important for you as a Crypto HODLers to make sure your loved ones can access your private keys and Crypto assets when you’re gone.

Giving assets to loved ones is better than losing them. Without a proper plan to transfer the private keys at the right time, your Crypto assets would be gone.

Just have an inheritance plan in place!

2022-07-29,Crypto Biz: Elon Musk: The ultimate crypto tourist - Cointelegraph,"Elon Musk’s Tesla proved to be the ultimate paper hands after the electric vehicle maker sold 75% of its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the second quarter. I say, good riddance. The cult of personality isn’t good for Bitcoin, and neither is a technologist who treats the asset as his plaything. As far as we are aware, Musk hasn’t sold any of his personal Bitcoin stash and Tesla still has an estimated 10,800 BTC on its books. Still, the less we have to hear about Musk and Bitcoin, the better.

In this week’s Crypto Biz, we chronicle Tesla’s sale of BTC, KuCoin’s fight against fake news and Cathie Wood’s sale of Coinbase stock.

Tesla reports $64 million profit from Bitcoin sale

Tesla’s decision to sell most of its Bitcoin wasn’t as boneheaded as it appeared at first. The company scored a $64 million profit in the exchange. Aside from selling emission credits, the electric vehicle maker has routinely struggled to turn a profit over the years. In a form 10-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla disclosed that it may “increase or decrease” its holdings of digital assets over time. Cynical prediction: ESG FUD will probably be the reason Tesla gets rid of its remaining holdings over time.

KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu launches “Anti-FUD Fund”

Crypto exchange KuCoin has been at the receiving end of a nasty smear campaign from a self-styled whistleblower tweeting about the company’s alleged insolvency. KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu has not only refuted claims that his company was facing a liquidity crisis, but he has also launched an “Anti-FUD Fund” to track down and take legal action against so-called “FUDers.” The Twitter account responsible for the misinformation appears to have been deleted.

(1/5) FUD benefits no one except the FUDers. It misleads investors and harms the industry’s image and market confidence.

Cathie Wood sells Coinbase shares amid insider trading allegations

Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management appears to be distancing itself from Coinbase amid allegations that the cryptocurrency exchange was involved in insider trading. After holding nearly $9 million in COIN stock as of late June, ARK offloaded more than 1.4 million shares over the next month. According to Bloomberg, Coinbase is being investigated by the SEC over its potential involvement in an ex-product manager’s insider trading scheme. Separately, and on an unrelated note, Coinbase is also being probed for allegedly selling unregistered securities. In the meantime, you won’t believe how badly COIN stock is down.

3AC: A $10 billion hedge fund gone bust with founders on the run

We’ve spent the past few months talking about the Three Arrows Capital debacle. The firm that also went by 3AC was revered for its investments, trading prowess and insights. The cult of personality surrounding its founders created an image of a company that could do no wrong. Then, it all came crashing down. As we wait for documentarians to make a movie about 3AC’s downfall, Cointelegraph has put together a lengthy expose about the whole ordeal. I’m talking timelines, analysis and information on who owes what to whom.

I've just seen the list of creditors to #3AC and noticed that @zhusu has filed a claim for $5 million.

The strategic investment capital gives MetaBeat benefits in furthering its technological development in the Web3 space, as well as supporting its marketing efforts in achieving its global goals.

With the assistance of its investors, MetaBeat will be tackling three key points in its industry on a global level: demolishing the high entry barrier of the music IP industry, overturning the unrecognized value of increasing fan contributions in the success of artists and bringing music fan communities and artists closer under decentralized autonomous organization governance.

MetaBeat plans to list on a global exchange and launch its Polygon and Solana multi-chain platform in the third quarter of this year. MetaBeat’s community ownership nonfungible tokens, backed by music IP, can be purchased with its native Polygon-based BEAT token. Through community ownership, fans will receive rewards in addition to participatory rewards in supporting artists. With BEAT tokens, fans can also purchase goods and various event tickets, stake BEAT and vote on community governance. Through this, MetaBeat will be achieving its goal of bringing together fans and artists under one platform.

Muse music goes on-chain

British rock band Muse’s upcoming new album will be released as a limited-edition NFT (non-fungible token) on the Polygon-powered platform Serenade, as reported by The Guardian. “Will of the People” is Muse’s ninth studio album, scheduled to be released on Aug. 26.

Serenade allows music fans to use their Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets to trade and collect NFTs tied to limited edition digital collectibles and digital pressings. Digital pressings, Serenade founder Max Shand explained, “provide full length audio and unique artwork, paired with unlockable rewards and a list of first owners that publicly tie fans to the artists and releases they love.”

“It’s premium vinyl for the web,” he tweeted.

Back in 2020, Muse also worked with Dapper Lab’s CryptoKitties project to create digital collectibles.

Muse’s NFT-bundled album is the first new format to be added to the UK’s Official Charts Company (OCC) charts in the UK and Australia. And it’s the first release on the OCC where the vendor, in this case Serenade, is approved as a chart return digital retailer, meaning sales on the platform contribute to official numbers.

NFT Worlds takes the ‘N,’ ‘F,’ ‘T’ out of Minecraft

Microsoft-owned Mojang, the game studio behind the massively popular Minecraft, recently decided to ban blockchain technology and NFTs on the title.

The move disrupted NFT and token integrations built by Web3 based game platforms such as NFT Worlds. The team’s associated token, WRLD, immediately tanked about 65%.

NFT Worlds responded by creating its own game and platform based on many of the core mechanics of Minecraft, and they named it Miecra — having removed the letters that make up “NFT” from the name of its inspiration.

“This is not a rewrite of some open source Minecraft clone, which likely would violate the EULA [end-user license agreement] or still risk legal action, this is entirely from the ground up. This transition will additionally come with a public facing brand identity change that is more player friendly,” tweeted the company, adding, “this is a web2 vs web3 battle.”

The updated WRLD tokenomics white paper outlines how the startup will incentivize participants to keep playing, while increasing the utility value of their digital assets as they build up reputations as players, creators or builders in the game world.

KuCoin launches an NFT ETF

Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin launched an ETF tied to blue-chip NFTs such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).

KuCoin’s new ETF is a tether-dominated product that buys into derivatives of certain digital assets. Its portfolio will first cover fractionalized tokens representing partial ownership of BAYC, CryptoPunks, Koda NFTs, The Sandbox deeds and Ethereum Name Service domains.

The fractionalized tokens are issued by Fracton Protocol’s meta-swap NFT fraction exchange aggregator. KuCoin’s ETF won’t trade on traditional stock exchanges, however — the exchange has instead launched a specialized “Trading Zone” on which its users can trade the fund.

The NFT ETF Trading Zone, according to a statement, aims to “improve the liquidity of NFT assets and lower the investment threshold of blue-chip NFTs for over 20 million users.” It also intends to eliminate concerns associated with crypto wallets, smart contracts and NFT marketplaces.

One contributor, for example: Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist protest and performance art collective, created the “Proof of Protest” NFT collection to raise funds for seven US-based organizations that support women’s reproductive rights.

The collection, powered by UnicornDAO and the public charity foundation Endaoment, raised more than $110,000 in less than 72 hours after its July 7 release. Within that time, the collection minted 13,201 NFTs sent to more than 9,700 unique wallet addresses.

Blockworks reached out to Lens Protocol, operated by Aave, to learn more from Christina Beltramini, head of growth and partnerships at Aave Companies.

Blockworks: How are Lens Protocol users interacting with its applications?

Beltramini: Currently, Lenster, a new decentralized and censorship resistant microblogging and social networking service is one of over 100 applications built on the Lens Protocol leveraging NFT technology, allowing users to fully own their data and unlocking new ways for creators to monetize their digital content and own their relationships with their communities

With Lens, each user’s followers, community, and content are linked to their NFT profile and can be ported into any new app powered by the protocol, giving creators the ability to be truly multi-platform and go direct-to-community.

The protocol also provides a user and creator-first foundation for any application to plug into, and gives people full ownership over their profile, content and relationships with their community with no overhead power with regard to how they control their content or their data.

Blockworks: How did Pussy Riot’s “Proof of Protest” NFT collection play out?

Beltramini: The NFTs were available to be collected directly on Lenster, which utilizes Lens’ collect module. As soon as they were collected, the posts became NFTs by being minted as publications on Lens. Specifically for this drop, Lenster ensured that creators, like Pussy Riot, were able to express their views safely without the risk of being suspended or shadow banned.

Creators are currently experimenting with creator monetization tools on Lens using the “collect module.” The most recent example of this tool being used to generate a profit (or in this case a donation) is Pussy Riot.

They raised more than 150,000 MATIC ($138,000) across three days through three different drops. Additionally, engagement for the open and limited editions has rivaled blue-chip NFT projects. They were also in the top 20 most active NFT contracts on Polygon — even compared to high-usage NFTs for gaming such as Aavegotchi and Cometh.

2022-07-20,Binance Dual Investment - Automatically Buy or Sell Crypto While Earning Interest - CoinCodex,"Binance Dual Investment is a unique product that’s part of Binance’s Earn offering. Compared to most other products featured on Binance Earn, Dual Investment is relatively complex, but it also opens up unique strategies for users.

When using Dual Investment, you can temporarily lock up your funds to buy or sell assets at a later date, while earning interest on your holdings in the meantime. You can enter a Dual Investment product with stablecoins (if you’re using the Buy Low mode) or standard cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (if you’re using the Sell High mode).

Create Binance Account

Binance Dual Investment explained

Perhaps the best way to explain Dual Investment is to go through some of the key concepts associated with the product. Let’s get started:

Buy Low

When subscribing to a Dual Investment product through the Buy Low mode, you deposit stablecoins (BUSD or USDT). The deposited funds will automatically be used to buy the specified cryptocurrency if its price on the settlement date is equal or lower than the target price.

For example, let’s say that BTC is currently trading at $25,000. You subscribe with USDT to a Dual Investment product using the Buy Low mode with a target price of $22,000 and an expiration date one week from now.

Scenario 1: On the expiration date, BTC is trading at $21,800, below the target price. Your USDT will automatically be used to purchase BTC at a price of $22,000 (our target price). While this price is less favorable than the current price ($21,800), you will also receive interest in the form of USDT that has accrued during the position.

On the expiration date, BTC is trading at $21,800, below the target price. Your USDT will automatically be used to purchase BTC at a price of $22,000 (our target price). While this price is less favorable than the current price ($21,800), you will also receive interest in the form of USDT that has accrued during the position. Scenario 2: On the expiration date, BTC is trading at $22,500, above the target price. You will receive your USDT back plus interest (in USDT).

Sell High

When subscribing to a Dual Investment product through the Sell High mode, you deposit a cryptocurrency, for example Bitcoin, Ethereum or BNB. The deposited crypto will be automatically sold if its price on the settlement date is equal or higher than the target price.

For example, let’s say that ETH is currently trading at $1,500. You subscribe with ETH to a Dual Investment product using the Sell High mode with a target price of $1,800 and an expiration date one week from now.

Scenario 1: On the expiration date, ETH is trading at $1,850, higher than the target price. Your ETH is automatically sold into stablecoins at the target price ($1,800). While this is a less favorable price than $1,850, you also receive interest paid with ETH.

On the expiration date, ETH is trading at $1,850, higher than the target price. Your ETH is automatically sold into stablecoins at the target price ($1,800). While this is a less favorable price than $1,850, you also receive interest paid with ETH. Scenario 2: On the expiration date, ETH is trading at $1,600, below our target price. You keep your ETH and also receive interest (paid in ETH).

Settlement date

The settlement date refers to the date at which your Dual Investment subscription will be settled. At the settlement date, the current price of the relevant cryptocurrency is checked against the target price, and your Dual Investment subscription is settled accordingly. Please note that you can’t cancel or redeem your Dual Investment subscription before the settlement date.

Target price

The target price is the price level that defines your Dual Investment subscription. At the settlement date, the current price of the relevant cryptocurrency is compared to the target price, and the subscription is settled accordingly.

When subscribing to a Dual Investment product using the Buy Low mode, the target price will be lower than the cryptocurrency’s current price. Conversely, the target price will be higher than the current price if you’re using the Sell High mode.

APR

You will earn interest on the cryptocurrency you deposit into Dual Investment, regardless of how your subscription is settled in the end. The interest is expressed with APR (Annual Percentage Rate), which tells you how much interest you would earn if the position was held for one year. In practice, Dual Investment subscriptions are much shorter. The APR paid by Dual Investment products will depend on the difference between the current price and Target Price, as well as the amount of time between now and the settlement date.

Dual Investment example

Now that we have a solid idea of how Dual Investment works, let’s go through an example of using the product.

Before we continue, we should mention that Dual Investment is not a risk-free product. Depending on the market’s movement, you could end up with less funds than you subscribed to the product with. After subscribing to a Dual Investment product, you won’t be able to access your funds until the settlement date. It’s not possible to redeem your Dual Investment position early.

In our example, we’ll be using ETH to subscribe to a Dual Investment product using the Sell High mode. We’ll also go through some different scenarios to show the benefits and disadvantages of Dual Investment.

We’ll go to the Binance website and select “Dual Investment” under the “Earn” tab.

Then, we use the search bar to find ETH to see all the available Dual Investment products for ETH.

TIP: You can choose between the standard interface and the Beginner Mode interface. If you choose Beginner Mode, the platform will provide some additional guidance to help you through the process of subscribing. We’ll be using the standard mode in our example.

Then, we select the “Sell High – Deposit ETH” option, as we want to use the Sell High mode. In our example, we’ll be choosing the Dual Investment product with the settlement date of July 29 target price of $1,800, and APR of 55.86%. Please note that this is not investment advice—we’re only selecting this product for illustrative purposes.

Binance provides a handy return calculator that will help you calculate how much you can expect to receive after your subscription expires. The calculator covers the scenarios in which the price of the cryptocurrency either reaches or fails to reach the target price.

Let’s say that today is July 20, 2022 and we’re holding 1 ETH. ETH is currently trading at a price of $1,607. We use our 1 ETH to subscribe to the Dual Investment product with the following parameters:

Mode: Sell High

Target price: $1,800

Settlement date: July 29, 2022

APR: 55.86%

The settlement date comes around, and it’s time for our position to be settled. What happens next will depend on what the price of ETH is.

Scenario 1: ETH is trading below the target price

If ETH is trading below our trading price at the settlement date, we receive our deposited ETH back, plus interest. So, we get 1 ETH + 0.01330 ETH = 1.0133 ETH. This outcome is better than if we just held our ETH.

Scenario 2: ETH is trading just above the target price

Let’s say that the price of ETH on the settlement date is $1,820. Since the target price was reached, our ETH is automatically sold for the BUSD stablecoin at the target price. We receive 1,800 BUSD, and the 0.01330 ETH interest that has accumulated is also converted into BUSD and paid to us. We receive roughly $1,823. This outcome is slightly better than if we just held our ETH – if we want, we can use the money to purchase slightly more than 1 ETH at the current market rate.

Scenario 3: ETH is trading significantly above the target price

On the settlement date, ETH is trading at $2,000, which is significantly higher than our target price. Since the target price was reached, our ETH is automatically sold into the BUSD stablecoin at a price of $1,800. The 0.01330 ETH interest that has accumulated is also converted into BUSD and paid to us.

We receive $1,800 + $26.6 = $1,826,6. This outcome is worse than if we just held our ETH, as we could have sold 1 ETH for $2,000.

The new auto-compounding feature

Binance recently announced the Auto-Compound feature, which makes it possible for users to automatically renew their Dual Investment subscriptions once they expire. Users can set up Auto-Compounding through two different plans.

Basic plan

If your target price is hit, the Auto-Compound plan will automatically stop. Your position will be closed and you will receive your crypto back, plus interest.

If your target price is not reached, you will be automatically subscribed to a new Dual Investment position, which will settle on the next available Settlement Date.

Advanced plan

If your target price is hit, you will be automatically subscribed to the next available position in the opposite direction (for example, from Buy Low to Sell High).

If your target price is not reached, you will be automatically subscribed to a new Dual Investment position in the same direction, which will settle on the next available Settlement Date.

You can cancel any active Auto-Compound plans up to 30 minutes before the settlement date of your active position. For more information, please refer to the Binance Dual Investment guide on Binance Academy.

The bottom line

Binance Dual Investment is a fairly complex product, but once you understand how it functions, it can be a valuable tool to have in your crypto investing arsenal. For example, you could use Dual Investment to grow your crypto stack when the market is in a neutral trend, or grow your stablecoin holdings.

Of course, there are risks associated with using the Dual Investment product, so make sure you understand the product well before committing any funds. Never invest more than you’re willing to lose.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE3MDExL2JpbmFuY2UtZHVhbC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWF1dG9tYXRpY2FsbHktYnV5LW9yLXNlbGwtY3J5cHRvLXdoaWxlLWVhcm5pbmctaW50ZXJlc3Qv0gF3aHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTcwMTEvYmluYW5jZS1kdWFsLWludmVzdG1lbnQtYXV0b21hdGljYWxseS1idXktb3Itc2VsbC1jcnlwdG8td2hpbGUtZWFybmluZy1pbnRlcmVzdC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-22,Dollar-Cost Average into Crypto with the New Auto-Invest 2.0 on ... - CoinCodex,"Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a popular investing strategy in which a set amount is invested in regular intervals. If you want to invest $1,000 into Ethereum, for example you could make the investment in one lump sum or break up the investment into smaller chunks to make it less likely your investment will be negatively impacted by short-term price volatility.

An example of a DCA strategy would be to invest $100 into Ethereum on the first Monday of every month, regardless of the ETH price. If you stuck with this strategy for 10 months, you would have invested a total of $1,000. Ideally, you would end up with more ETH than if you went with the $1,000 lump sum investment, but this isn’t guaranteed.

The idea behind DCA is to minimize the effect of short-term volatility on the investment. This strategy can be suitable for investors who have a long-term bullish outlook on the asset, are not interested in “timing the market” and don’t have a strong opinion on whether the price of the asset is too low or too high from a short-term perspective.

Even just a few years ago, crypto investors who wanted to employ a DCA strategy had to make their scheduled purchases manually. However, some cryptocurrency exchanges have thankfully caught on to the popularity of dollar-cost averaging and now offer products that help users automated their DCA strategy.

One such example is Binance, which is the leading cryptocurrency exchange in both trading volume and user count. Binance users can implement DCA strategies for a variety of cryptocurrencies using the exchange’s Auto-Invest feature. It’s also possible to DCA into a portfolio of cryptocurrencies, instead of only buying one cryptocurrency. For these reasons, Binance is one of the leading options for those looking to invest in crypto.

Before we show you how you can implement a DCA plan on Binance using Auto-Invest, let’s check out some of the product’s top features:

Supports more than 50 different cryptocurrencies

Each purchase can be as small as 1 USDT

Create a DCA plan for one crypto asset or automatically invest in a portfolio of different coins

Pay with USDT or BUSD

Supports daily, weekly, bi-weekly and monthly purchases

How to use Auto-Invest on Binance?

The first step to getting started with Auto-Invest is creating an account on Binance. It’s advisable that you download the Binance mobile app, since the latest Auto-Invest 2.0 feature is currently only available on the app. The examples in this article will be using the mobile app.

Create Binance Account

You should also top up your Binance account up with some USDT or BUSD, since those are the two stablecoins supported by Auto-Invest. Your automated purchases will not go through if your USDT or BUSD balance is not high enough to make the investment. If you want to end your plan, you can cancel existing Auto-Invest plans with no additional costs.

Before we continue, we should mention that the DCA plans we’ll be showing in our examples are not meant as investment advice, but are only meant to illustrate how Binance’s Auto-Invest product works.

Once you’re logged in to your Binance app, click on “More” to find the entire range of products offered by the exchange.

Then, select the “Auto-Invest” option. You’ll be able to find it in the “Earn” section or the “Recommend” tab.

Now you can decide if you want to create a dollar-cost averaging plan for just one cryptocurrency, or if you want to make a DCA plan for a portfolio of cryptocurrencies.

Single Token mode

In this example, we’ll be creating a DCA plan for investing in ETH. Find the cryptocurrency you want to invest in using the search bar.

We’re ready to customize our DCA plan for ETH. Let’s say that we want to invest 25 USDT into ETH every week. We can get even more specific and make the investments every Wednesday at 08:00 AM. Here’s how you would create a DCA plan with those parameters:

Below, you’ll be able to find a summary of the plan you’re creating, including the date and time at which the plan’s first investment will be made. If you agree with the Binance Auto-Invest Agreement, click “Confirm” to proceed.

Portfolio mode

If you want to invest in a portfolio of different cryptocurrencies, select the “Portfolio” option. If you want to create a custom portfolio, select “Create a portfolio plan”. You can also consider the options under the “Pre-set Selection” plans, which include pre-made portfolios. We’ll be making our own portfolio with 4 cryptocurrencies in this example.

Select the coins that you want to include in your Auto-Invest portfolio. In our example, we will be choosing BNB, BTC, ETH and SOL. Once you’ve selected all the coins you want to include, click “Confirm”.

The next step is to choose the allocation of the assets included in your portfolio. Since this is expressed in percentages, the values you enter must add up to 100%. We’ll be putting 40% of our portfolio into BTC, 30% into ETH, while BNB and SOL will have an allocation of 15% each.

We’ll set up the plan so that it invests 200 USDT on the 3rd day of every month. The investment will be split into the 4 cryptocurrencies we selected according to their allocation. 40% of the 2000 USDT will be going into BTC, 30% will be going into ETH, and so forth.

Take a look at the summary to see when the plan’s investment will be made. If everything looks good and you agree with the Binance Auto-Invest Agreement, click “Confirm” to proceed and activate your plan.

What’s new in Auto-Invest 2.0?

Binance has recently upgraded the Auto-Invest feature on its mobile app for iOS and Android devices. The new “Auto-Invest 2.0” has several improvements that are designed to improve the user experience and make the product more intuitive. Let’s quickly take a look at what Auto-Invest 2.0 has to offer.

Try out the new Auto-Invest 2.0 on Binance

Lower minimum

Automated dollar-cost averaging is now more accessible than ever on Binance, as the minimum investment size on Auto-Invest 2.0 has been reduced all the way down to 1 USDT. For example, you can choose to only invest as little as 1 USDT per month, if that’s what you want.

A new learning section

Auto-Invest 2.0 has a “Learn More” section where you can quickly learn about the product and see the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.

Binance’s Auto-Invest feature is one of the easiest ways to create an automated plan for dollar-cost averaging into cryptocurrency. It supports a very large selection of cryptocurrencies, and offers a lot of flexibility thanks to low minimums and four different time intervals (daily, weekly, bi-weekly and monthly). The ability to implement a DCA strategy for a portfolio of cryptocurrencies is also extremely helpful for users who are interested in more than one cryptocurrency. The upgrades under the “Auto-Invest 2.0” banner go even further in making Auto-Invest arguably the best product for DCA in crypto.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE4MjA3L2RvbGxhci1jb3N0LWF2ZXJhZ2UtaW50by1jcnlwdG8td2l0aC10aGUtbmV3LWF1dG8taW52ZXN0LTIwLW9uLWJpbmFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-07-29,Klein Finance Mainnet official launch - Cointelegraph,"On July 29, 2022, Klein Finance announced mainnet official launch based on KCC ecology. At present, users can transfer their token assets such as ERC-20, BSC and Polygen to the KCC main network through the cross-chain bridge. And participate in Klein Finance staking, add liquidity to obtain income.

Klein Finance is a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) on KCC (KuCoin Community Chain), on which tokens under KRC 20 standard can be traded. Klein Finance Aims to allow digital assets to be traded in a safe and stable on-chain environment with low slippage, good depth, and low fees, it also enables users to obtain rewards by locking digital assets. With a mixed liquidity pool trading model, Klein Finance provides a cross-market mechanism for creating stablecoins liquidity pools as well as non-stablecoin trading pairs.

About Klein Finance

Klein Finance plays an important role in the KCC ecosystem, and along with major DeFi protocols such as Uniswap on Ethereum and Curve Finance, Klein Finance provides liquidity for many large back-end platforms. It maximizes returns and gives the protocol an advantage in maintaining market share

Klein Finance is recognized as a major part of the KCC DeFi ecosystem. It allows users providing liquidity and trading with KRC20 tokens on the KCC. However, the transaction mode adopted is a mixed liquidity pool, which provides a cross-market mechanism for creating stablecoins liquidity pools without permission.

Klein Finance’s immutability allows most of the liquidity to be concentrated around the price of 1.0 (or any real price), and this is a very useful feature for creating liquidity as well as lowering impermanent losses between stablecoins.

Automated market making using dynamic peg creates liquidity for assets that are not necessarily pegged to each other in a more efficient way than m * n = λ invariant. This creates 5–10 times more liquidity than Uniswap and also provides higher profits for liquidity providers.

Conclusion

Klein Finance applies a completely different technical path from Uniswap V3 in terms of AMM. In Uniswap V3, Liquidity Providers can decide the price range they’d like to provide with, which can be risky for novice users as there is high potential impermanent losses. Klein on the contrary, can automatically adjust the liquidity aggregation range based on the internal Oracle. Thus no need for users to redeploy the liquidity range. This design is more friendly to novice investors and does not require liquidity providers to formulate complex market-making strategies.

This article has generally discussed underlying architecture, key functions as well as basic technical paths of Klein Finance. It can be observed that Klein Finance trading platform performs well in stablecoin trading, but in the field of non-stablecoin trading, AMM of dynamic peg is still in process of exploration. In later articles, we will further discuss detailed technical methods and advanced trading strategies of Klein Finance platform.

2022-08-23,StarTerra Rebranded to GameSwift a Game Changer in Web3 Gaming - CoinCodex,"The game industry has been significantly impacted by Web3. Web3-based games enable players to interact with the games in creative and decentralized ways, which is a significant change from traditional gaming platforms. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs allow users to discover new possibilities, such as earning crypto while playing. By revolutionizing all facets of gaming, this removes the need for a single central authority to control everything and instead gives control to the players.

Game developers own the copyrights to in-game content. Though in traditional gaming, in-game items can be bought with real money or claimed as rewards, players do not own those in-game items in the actual sense. In other words, player ownership in traditional gaming is merely a type of permission to interact with the game's features.

Furthermore, all data associated with centralized gaming servers are kept on servers that are entirely under the authority and management of game administrators. In traditional gaming, developers lack the ability to monitor and approve incentive-yielding transactions between players.

Web3 gaming offers the gaming industry fair virtual marketplaces where users may access and fully own in-game digital assets. These assets are unique in that they are mostly kept in the form of gaming NFTs.

By connecting the in-game assets and players across platforms, Web3 gaming also offers a wide range of interoperability among different gaming ecosystems. The blockchain technology that is chosen to create a gaming ecosystem will definitely have an impact on interoperability.

StarTerra and its Evolution

StarTerra, the first and largest launchpad in the Terra ecosystem, became well-known for gamifying the process of funding new projects, and by making numerous advancements in the crowdfunding sector. It introduced solutions like an automated allocation system, prizes for top performers, and other innovative features. The new funding strategy, IDO (initial DEX offering) attracted more investors than DAO Maker, on average, resulting in what we now know as the biggest platform in the web3 ecosystem.

StarTerra uses STT as its native token. As more people acquire IDO tokens, demand normally declines. Due to the fact that StarTerra did not want this to occur to STT, it has adopted deflationary tokenomics (30% of transaction fees are spent burning STT).

StarTerra has completed a rebranding process and is currently shifting to its own chain built by taking advantage of Polygon's technology. Additionally, the company has modified its business plan, concentrating majorly on the web3 gaming sector, and rebranding as GameSwift. As part of the collaboration, Polygon provided the GameSwift team with a special financial incentive, making GameSwift the ecosystem of first preference for any web3 games built on Polygon.

GameSwift

GameSwift is an innovative product that is completely changing the web3 gaming sector. The platform offers all the components required to launch a true web3 game. It provides a completely decentralized and community-driven environment. It serves as both an all-around platform for game developers and gaming studios, offering all the resources required to introduce web2 games into the web3 space. Furthermore, it serves as a community space for true gamers who want to participate in the cryptocurrency community and join the web3 movement.

GameSwift was created as a result of the fusion of decentralized financial technology, powerful blockchain innovation, gaming passion, and technical expertise. With the help of these enabling technologies, GameSwift presents the web3 gaming of the future.

Utilizing experts in the blockchain industry, GameSwift aims to bring major changes to the world of gaming. The platform seeks to create a vast ecosystem with all the tools and resources the gaming industry could possibly need. Some of the major products that are part of the GameSwift ecosystem and will also be launched soon include:

GameSwift Chain

GameSwift Platform

GameSwift Analytics

GameSwift ID

GameSwift Extension

GameSwift Launcher

GameSwift Bridge

GameSwift Studios

These are just a few of the products stipulated to be released soon.

The fundamental business of GameSwift changed in response to market demands. Since 2020, the blockchain-based web3 gaming sector has been growing rapidly, and the future of the industry is quite promising. Investor contributions to new web3 projects reached $1 billion in January 2022 alone, which is 25% more than in 2021. By the end of this year, web3 gaming would have, undoubtedly, received a record number of new investments.

Explaining GameSwift’s new direction, CEO Wojciech Gruszka, said:",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE4MjIxL3N0YXJ0ZXJyYS1yZWJyYW5kZWQtdG8tZ2FtZXN3aWZ0LWEtZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2VyLWluLXdlYjMtZ2FtaW5nL9IBZmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE4MjIxL3N0YXJ0ZXJyYS1yZWJyYW5kZWQtdG8tZ2FtZXN3aWZ0LWEtZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2VyLWluLXdlYjMtZ2FtaW5nLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-08,"FTX, Bybit rise in web traffic despite overall traffic drop on CEXs - Cointelegraph","The ongoing cryptocurrency winter has triggered an overall decline in interest in centralized crypto exchanges (CEX), but some crypto trading platforms have seen a rise in website traffic.

A few major global crypto exchanges, including Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, have experienced a significant increase in web traffic despite the bear market of 2022, according to the website analytics platform Similarweb.

According to data shared with Cointelegraph, web traffic on the FTX crypto exchange had surged as much as 123% year-over-year (YoY) by June 2022.

Trading platforms WhiteBit and Bybit have seen even bigger growth in interest, with traffic surging 244% and 160% over the past year, respectively. The KuCoin crypto exchange has also seen an increase in interest over the past year, with its website’s traffic edging up 50% YoY.

The traffic growth of FTX and Bybit has come against the backdrop of the majority of CEXs experiencing a massive drop in interest in their websites.

Major United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase saw its web traffic plummet 46% YoY, experiencing one of the biggest losses among U.S. crypto exchanges. Rival exchanges Kraken and Bittrex have also posted traffic losses, with visits dropping 38% and 54%, respectively.

The traffic on the global Binance crypto exchange tumbled about 40%, according to data from Similarweb. The major blockchain browser and crypto wallet Blockchain.com also saw its traffic dropping 30%.

Crypto-friendly stock trading app Robinhood has also plummeted traffic-wise, with website visits dipping 65% YoY.

Despite a significant drop in website visits on many CEXs, the traffic on most crypto exchanges has still been up over the past three years. As such, web traffic on Coinbase, Kraken and Binance is up 36%, 105% and 263% over the period, respectively. Growing-traffic exchanges such as Bybit and FTX have seen their visits skyrocket 1,600% and 9,400% over the period, respectively.

In contrast, some platforms like Bittrex.com and Blockchain.com have seen some traffic decline even over a longer period of time, with visits dropping 67% and 54% over the past three years, respectively.

The discrepancy between traffic movements on different crypto exchanges might be a reason for how different companies position themselves during tough times on the market.

According to David Carr, senior insights manager at Similarweb, some exchanges like FTX have demonstrated more courage than other firms by forcing acquisitions and helping bankrupt platforms.

“More recently, FTX has been in the news as an acquirer or potential acquirer of other companies, such as some of the crypto lending and DeFi companies that were struggling but that FTX and its CEO thought had value,” Carr said. In the meantime, Coinbase might have suffered from “unfortunate headlines” about disclosing what would happen to customer funds if the company went bankrupt, he said, adding:

“Not that Coinbase is necessarily on the verge of bankruptcy, but just having the company name and bankruptcy in the same sentence was not a good thing.”

Coinbase is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the United States and has been a publicly traded company since April 2021. The exchange has been involved in a number of regulatory conflicts recently, with U.S. authorities arresting a former Coinbase manager on allegations of insider trading in July. Already under investigation by the Securities and Exchanges Commission, Coinbase was slapped with two fresh legal claims last week.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9mdHgtYnliaXQtcmlzZS1pbi13ZWItdHJhZmZpYy1kZXNwaXRlLW92ZXJhbGwtdHJhZmZpYy1kcm9wLW9uLWNleHPSAWVodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvZnR4LWJ5Yml0LXJpc2UtaW4td2ViLXRyYWZmaWMtZGVzcGl0ZS1vdmVyYWxsLXRyYWZmaWMtZHJvcC1vbi1jZXhzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-08-15,Polkadot-Powered Stablecoin Tanks As Hackers Mint 1.3B Tokens - Blockworks,"key takeaways Hackers attacked Acala’s new liquidity pool to mint more than one billion aUSD tokens

aUSD crashed almost immediately but has since rebounded, now trading above $0.90

Polkadot-powered stablecoin acala dollar (aUSD) crashed to below 10 cents on Sunday after hackers minted 1.3 billion of the tokens for free.

The stablecoin’s issuing network Acala voted to suspend functionality to address the situation. In a tweet on Sunday, Acala said it noticed a configuration issue on its stablecoin protocol Honzon, which directly affects how aUSD operates.

Acala, one of the first Polkadot parachains, styles itself as a “DeFi hub” for the network. It had just launched a yield-bearing liquidity pool for aUSD and a form of wrapped bitcoin, which contained a bug dictating how the pool pays out rewards.

On-chain observers found hackers had exploited the flaw to mint 1.3 billion aUSD, with one attacker wallet holding about 1.27 billion aUSD.

The incident resulted in aUSD, which had held its soft peg since its February launch, crashing as low as $0.07 on KuCoin, echoing TerraUSD’s collapse in May.

However, aUSD quickly rebounded and now trades for more than $0.90. Blockchain explorers show aUSD’s official supply is almost 4.8 million tokens.

While Acala’s Honzon protocol manages the stablecoin based on various risk management algorithms, aUSD’s value is also derived from a basket of reserve assets, mostly Polkadot ecosystem tokens. Users can mint aUSD by sending certain digital assets to the protocol.

“This enables people to transact, trade, and facilitate services using aUSD without price volatility,” it said in aUSD’s announcement post.

Polkadot networks handle hackers with governance votes

Acala has labeled the snafu a “misconfiguration,” saying it had been rectified the same day and wallet addresses that received the erroneously-minted aUSD had been identified.

The network itself hasn’t disclosed the amount of tokens printed throughout the incident, but said it managed to retain over 99% of the tokens involved.

The remaining illicit aUSD has been locked until a collective governance decision on what to do next has been voted upon, Acala added.

Loading Tweet..

Last October, experimental Polkadot implementation Kusama similarly voted to manage a security vulnerability involving stolen tokens.

Both Acala Network and co-founder Bette Chen didn’t return Blockworks’ request for comment by press time.

Acala’s ACA has shed about 13% since the attack. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a tweet that the exchange was “monitoring” the situation. Binance doesn’t list aUSD but does support ACA trade.

2022-08-26,How to tell if a cryptocurrency project is a Ponzi scheme - Cointelegraph,"The crypto world has experienced an increase in Ponzi schemes since 2016 when the market gained mainstream prominence. Many shady investment programs are designed to take advantage of the hype behind cryptocurrency booms to beguile impressionable investors.

Ponzi schemes have become rampant in the sector primarily due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology which enables scammers to sidestep centralized monetary authorities who would otherwise flag or freeze suspicious transactions.

The immutable nature of blockchain systems that makes fund transfers irreversible also works in the scammers’ favor by making it harder for Ponzi victims to get their money back.

Speaking to Cointelegraph earlier this week, Johnny Lyu, CEO of crypto exchange KuCoin, said that the sector was fertile ground for these types of schemes due to one main reason:

“The industry is full of users eager to invest their money, and there is virtually no regulation that would stop projects from hiding their malicious intentions.”

“Until clear and internationally approved financial regulation of the crypto industry is set in place, it will continue to witness the rise and collapse of Ponzi schemes,” he added.

How Ponzi schemes work

The Ponzi scheme phrase emerged in 1920 when a swindler named Charles Ponzi marketed a high-returns program to investors which supposedly leveraged postal reply coupons to achieve impressive earnings.

He promised investors returns of up to 50% within 45 days or 100% interest within 90 days. True to his word, the first group of investors got the claimed returns, but unbeknownst to them, the money they received was actually from later investors. The cycle was designed to lure new investors and enabled Ponzi to steal over $20 million.

While he wasn’t the first to use such a scheme to scam people, he was the first to use it to such a scale. Hence, the technique was named after him.

In a nutshell, a Ponzi scheme is a fake investment program that promises astronomical gains to clients but uses money collected from new investors to pay early investors. This helps the swindlers behind such operations to maintain some semblance of legitimacy and entice new investors.

That said, Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of cash to be sustainable. The ruse usually comes to an end when the number of new recruits falls or when investors choose to withdraw their money en masse.

How to spot a crypto Ponzi scheme

There has been a sharp rise in the number of Ponzi schemes in recent years in tandem with the crypto market’s uptrend. As such, it is important to know how to spot a Ponzi scheme.

The following are some of the aspects to look out for when considering whether a crypto project is a Ponzi scheme.

Promises of ridiculously high returns

Many crypto Ponzi schemes claim to reward investors with hefty returns with little risk. This, however, contradicts how investing in the real world works. In reality, every investment comes with a certain amount of risk.

Typical crypto investments fluctuate according to prevailing market conditions, so such claims should be viewed as a red flag. In many cases, investors who join such networks never get any returns on their money.

Khaleelulla Baig, the founder and CEO of KoinBasket — a crypto index trading platform — told Cointelegraph that transparency should be the topmost factor to consider before investing money in a crypto project:

“What really matters is the transparency about the project details. Most founders build their business on hope and rosy projections. Check the past track record of the founding team’s delivery track record vs. commitment.”

He also advised investors to stay away from projects with obscure fundamentals that are based on external influences.

Unregistered investment projects

It is important to confirm whether a crypto company is registered with regulatory organizations such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission before investing any money. Registered crypto companies are usually required to submit details regarding their revenue models to their respective regulatory authorities to avoid penalties. As such, they are unlikely to participate in Ponzi schemes.

Projects registered in jurisdictions with lax crypto regulations that additionally have Ponzi-like characteristics should be avoided.

Some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, have already come up with elaborate crypto regulations designed to protect crypto investors against these types of scams. According to a recent proposal passed by European Council, crypto companies will soon be obligated to abide by Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules and will be required to have a license to operate in the region.

Putting crypto companies under MiCA will compel them to reveal their revenue models, and this will temper the rise of crypto enterprises relying on Ponzi-like plans in the bloc.

Use of sophisticated investment strategies

Ponzi schemes usually allude to complex trading strategies as part of the reason why they are able to obtain high yields with minimal risks. Many of their outlined growth strategies are usually hard to understand, but this is usually done on purpose to avoid scrutiny.

The Bitconnect Ponzi scheme that was unveiled in 2016 is an example of a Ponzi scheme that utilized this tactic to trick investors. Its operators encouraged investors to buy BCC coins and lock them on the platform to allow its “sophisticated” lending software to trade the funds. The platform claimed to provide monthly yields of up to 120% per year.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was among the first notable figures to raise the alarm on the project. The scheme was brought down by U.S. and British authorities, who declared it a Ponzi scheme. Its closure in 2018 triggered a BCC price drop that led to billions of dollars in losses.

High level of centralization

Ponzi schemes are usually run on centralized platforms. One crypto Ponzi that was based on a highly centralized network is the OneCoin Ponzi scheme. The pyramid scheme, which ran between 2014 and 2019, defrauded investors out of some $5 billion. The project relied on its own internal servers to run the ploy and lacked a blockchain system.

Subsequently, OneCoin could only be traded on the OneCoin Exchange, its native marketplace. The tokens could be exchanged for cash, with fund transfers being made via wire.

The OneCoin marketplace also had daily withdrawal limits that prevented investors from withdrawing all their funds at once.

The scheme went down in 2019 following the arrest of some key members of the operation. However, there is an outstanding federal arrest warrant for OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova, who is still at large.

Multilevel marketing

KuCoin’s Lyu noted that the ominous red flags hadn’t changed much over the years and multilevel marketing was still at the heart of many Ponzi schemes:

“Complex earning schemes involving multiple tiers of users, referral programs, percentages, sliding scales, and other tricks are all signs of a Ponzi scheme that feeds the upper tiers using the funds injected by the lower tiers without actually doing any business.”

Multilevel marketing is a controversial marketing technique that requires participants to generate revenues by marketing certain products and services and recruiting others to join the network. Commissions earned by new recruits are shared with the up-line members.

One Ponzi scheme that recently made headlines for making use of this hierarchical system is GainBitcoin. The pyramid scheme headed by Amit Bhardwaj had seven primary recruiters who were based in India and on different continents around the world. Each of them was tasked with recruiting investors into the network.

The scheme guaranteed users 10% monthly returns on their Bitcoin (BTC) deposits for 18 months.

The scheme is alleged to have collected between 385,000 and 600,000 BTC from investors.

Ponzi schemes have been used by scammers for over a hundred years. However, they have been able to thrive in the crypto industry due to the lack of elaborate regulations governing the sector.

Because the crypto world is susceptible to these types of schemes, it is important to exercise caution before investing in any novel project.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8tdGVsbC1pZi1hLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LXByb2plY3QtaXMtYS1wb256aS1zY2hlbWXSAVxodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvaG93LXRvLXRlbGwtaWYtYS1jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1wcm9qZWN0LWlzLWEtcG9uemktc2NoZW1lL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-08-16,"Women are leading in Web3, majority believe it will define the ... - CoinGeek","We may not all agree over what Web3 is, or isn’t for that matter, but a majority of people believe it will define the future of the Internet, a new report has revealed. The report by KuCoin exchange also revealed that while blockchain is a male-dominated field, women are taking the lead in Web3, and as KuCoin Labs head Lou Yu told CoinGeek, this could lay the foundation for its success.

Titled the ‘Web 3 Career Market Report,’ it revealed that Web3 is becoming a big player in professional circles, with 16% of the 3,600+ respondents saying they worked in this sector. However, this was a generalized take on Web3, encompassing those working in DeFi, NFTs, the metaverse, digital asset projects, and more, which are not always necessarily Web3 companies.

“The majority believes that Web 3 leads to a decentralized new world and defines the future of the internet, going beyond crypto adoption,” the report found.

That Web3 will change the Internet is not in question. However, as it is today, it’s still in its infancy, and moreover, it’s still not clear which businesses are really Web3. As Britevue founder Connor Murray joked, “Web3 is just a meme at this point. As far as I can tell, web3 just refers to signing onto a platform with a crypto wallet.”

However, it’s much more than using a token. In essence, Web3 relates to data ownership. It’s the iteration of the Internet that allows users to own their data and do with it as they please, including monetizing it.

Johnny Lyu, the KuCoin CEO, concurs. Speaking to CoinGeek, he noted that “At present, the Web3 sector is headed more in the financial direction. However, Web3 is more than just transactions in the blockchain space on gaming concepts.”

Women taking the lead in Web3

Men dominate the blockchain sector, and expectedly so as it combines finance with technology, two largely male-dominated areas. However, in Web3, women have found their voice and are taking the lead.

The report found that female Web3 professionals are generally more active career-wise than their male counterparts. Further, 27% of these professionals have been involved in starting Web3-related projects or businesses.

Commenting on the role of women in this emerging sector, Lou Yu told CoinGeek, “Women can add their unique perspective on Web3 when engaged in the development of products for it.”

“The current Web3 environment can leverage the potential of women by giving them leading roles in product development, thus gaining invaluable insights into resulting traction. I am certain that female professionals can contribute unique and creative approaches to the overall rise of Web3 as a space of countless use cases and applications for the entire global online population,” Yu, a female pioneer in Web 3.0 herself, added.

The female trailblazers in Web 3.0 face unique challenges, however. 33% of the respondents identified the “bro” culture as the biggest impediment to women, with a lack of proper educational resources also being a major challenge. However, the ‘bro culture’ isn’t unique to Web3 and is only now being slowly phased out of the startup world.

Yu heads KuCoin Labs, the investment arm of the exchange, which in November last year raised a $100 million metaverse fund. As she told CoinGeek Conversations recently, she is super-bullish on the metaverse, which she says is “the place to be for the next generation of entrepreneurial internet users.”

While its stated area of focus is the metaverse, Yu revealed that it would go towards building Web3. She means to make the fund “a launchpad for promising projects that adhere to our inclusive and user-oriented vision of Web3. Over the years of working in the industry, I have become convinced that the future of Web3 lies with projects that are not after massive capitalization, but catering to real user demands. And my experience also dictates that such projects are in most need of financing.”

If you use FTX US and desire to trade futures with BTCC, you have come to the right place. Here, we will discuss in details how you can transfer crypto from FTX US to BTCC. Before delving in, we will briefly discuss a few other things you need to understand.

Why transfer crypto from FTX US to BTCC?

Step 1 – Log in to your BTCC account and select ""Deposit"" under the assets menu.

Step 2 – Select the cryptocurrency you want to transfer. Here, we will demonstrate how to transfer USDT, so select USDT.

Step 4 – Proceed to your FTX US account. It is important to state that what you are going to do on FTX US is to withdraw the asset you intend to transfer to your BTCC account.

Step 5 – Click on the “Wallet” icon on the bottom of the screen and it will take you into the Wallet Tab, then press Withdraw that is located on the top of the screen.

Step 6 – Within the Withdraw Tab, locate the crypto you want to transfer to BTCC. In this case, USDT. You can scroll down to locate it if you have several other assets in the account.

Step 7 – When you locate the asset (USDT) click on it. This will take you to a withdrawal menu window.

Step 8 – Within the withdrawal window, input the amount you want to transfer to BTCC and then paste the destination address you copied from BTCC. After inputting the correct amount and destination address, enter your 2FA code and click the “Withdraw” button at the bottom right of the screen. You should see a success message after this, but you can also confirm the status of your transfer by clicking the “Withdrawals” tab within the “Wallet” page.

Step 9 – Go back to the BTCC app, click on “Assets”, and you should be able to see the deposit in your account shortly.

Most withdrawals are completed instantly. If you don’t see your transferred assets in your account after a while, you can contact the BTCC customer service team for assistance.

Wrapping up

Obviously, transferring crypto from FTX US to BTCC is simple and straightforward. However, you need to follow the steps above carefully. You also need to ensure that you copy and paste the right destination address. Once your transfer is successful, you can proceed to trade futures on BTCC immediately or do anything else and enjoy all the accompanying benefits.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE3NTQ5L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci1jcnlwdG8tZnJvbS1mdHgtdXMtdG8tYnRjYy_SAVJodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzU0OS9ob3ctdG8tdHJhbnNmZXItY3J5cHRvLWZyb20tZnR4LXVzLXRvLWJ0Y2Mv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-11,CopperStealer Distributes Malicious Chromium-based Browser ... - Trend Micro,"Update (8/12/2022 2:05AM EST): We have updated the list of IOCs and detections.

We published our analyses on CopperStealer distributing malware by abusing various components such as browser stealer, adware browser extension, or remote desktop. Tracking the cybercriminal group’s latest activities, we found a malicious browser extension capable of creating and stealing API keys from infected machines when the victim is logged in to a major cryptocurrency exchange website. These API keys allow the extension to perform transactions and send cryptocurrencies from victims’ wallets to the attackers’ wallets.

Similar to previous routines, this new component is spread via fake crack (also known as warez) websites. The component is usually distributed in one dropper together with a browser stealer and bundled with other unrelated pieces of malware. This bundle is compressed into a password-protected archive and has been distributed in the wild since July.

BTCC's selection of futures contracts includes daily, weekly, quarterly and perpetual contracts. Users that want to start trading crypto futures on BTCC can get started quickly after creating their accounts.

Of course, you need to add some funds to your BTCC account before you can start trading. In this guide, we'll be giving you a step-by-step guide showing you how to transfer cryptocurrency from the Kraken exchange over to BTCC.

Why transfer crypto from Kraken to BTCC?

There are many reasons you may want to transfer your digital assets from another exchange to BTCC. For example, you might want to take advantage of the futures contracts and leverage offered by BTCC, which you may not have access to on your current exchange of choice.

You may also want to transfer crypto from Kraken or another exchange to BTCC for other reasons. As one of the longest running cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, BTCC offers several benefits to users. Here are a few of its major perks:

BTCC has a record of offering quality service for more than 11 years in the crypto world

BTCC is a user-friendly platform built for everyone

BTCC offers a low investment threshold but also accommodate big investors

Registration takes less than a minute

If you don’t have an account with BTCC at the moment, there is no need to worry. Registration is absolutely free and the entire process takes less than a minute.

Create BTCC Account

If you are unsure of the entire signup process and want to know more how to proceed, then BTCC's ultimate guide will be very helpful. It will even teach you how to trade futures on the platform.

Transfer your crypto from Kraken to BTCC

It is important to start this section by stating that the steps to follow when using the BTCC app are practically the same steps to follow when using the web platform. For the sake of convenience, we will focus on how to complete the transfer from the app.

Are you now ready to transfer your crypto from Kraken to BTCC? Here are the exact steps you need to follow:

Step 1 – Log in to your BTCC account and select ""Deposit"" under the assets menu.

Step 2 – Select the cryptocurrency you want to transfer. Here, we will demonstrate how to transfer USDT, so select USDT. Make sure to choose the correct blockchain network on which you will be sending the USDT tokens. In our example, we are selecting the ERC20 chain, which corresponds to Ethereum. It is important to reiterate that you must choose the correct blockchain network on BTCC and choose the same network on the withdrawal platform (in this case Kraken). If you don’t choose correctly, your assets will not arrive to their intended destination and may never be recovered.

Step 3 – Copy the Wallet Address by tapping the Copy Address button or copy icons on the screen.

At this point, it is important to note that some cryptocurrencies like XRP use a destination tag. It is crucial to copy both the wallet address and destination tag and input them correctly on the withdrawal platform. Failure to do so could result in the loss of assets.

Step 4 – Proceed to your Kraken account. It is important to state that what you are going to do on Kraken is to withdraw the asset you intend to transfer to your BTCC account. Select the ""Balances"" section and then click on ""Withdraw"".

Step 5 – Select Tether (USDT) as the currency that you want to withdraw.

Step 6 – Choose the withdrawal method. In our example, we will be transacting over the Ethereum network, so we will be choosing the ERC20 option.

Step 7 – Now, paste in the Ethereum address that you copied from the BTCC app. We recommend you to double-check and ensure that the address is correct. After clicking ""Next"", Kraken will ask you to confirm the address via email.

Step 8 – After confirming the withdrawal address, you will be able to withdraw USDT from Kraken. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw.

Tip: If you plan to transfer an amount that is significant to you, consider making a smaller test transaction first to ensure that everything is working correctly. If the test transaction is successful, you can then proceed with transferring the full amount.

Step 9 – Review the withdrawal, method, amount and fee. If everything checks out, you can confirm the withdrawal by swiping the button at the bottom of the interface.

Most withdrawals are completed instantly. If you don’t see your transferred assets in your account after a while, you can contact the BTCC customer service team for assistance.

Step 10 – Go back to your BTCC app to check if the deposit has arrived. The deposit should be credited to your account fairly quickly, although this could depend on network conditions—sometimes, Ethereum transactions can be slowed down by network congestion. Transacting on the TRON network (TRC20) is usually faster than using the Ethereum network (ERC20).

Wrapping up

Obviously, transferring crypto from Kraken to BTCC is simple and straightforward. However, you need to follow the steps above carefully. You also need to ensure that you copy and paste the right destination address. Once your transfer is successful, you can proceed to trade futures on BTCC immediately or do anything else and enjoy all the accompanying benefits.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE3Nzg1L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci1jcnlwdG8tZnJvbS1rcmFrZW4tdG8tYnRjYy_SAVJodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzc4NS9ob3ctdG8tdHJhbnNmZXItY3J5cHRvLWZyb20ta3Jha2VuLXRvLWJ0Y2Mv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-08-09,Game Space sees 400% user growth since the launch of its Steam event in July - AMBCrypto News,"Recently, Game Space, the first GameFi as a Service platform in the whole industry opened a Genesis NFT AirDrop event for one billion Steam players. At present, Game Space has joined forces with more than ten institutions such as ByBit, Gate.io, Huobi, KuCoin Wallet, BitKeep, DAOs and Gaming Guilds to AirDrop NFTs to Steam users. The event time started at 12:00 UTC on July 28 to 12:00 UTC on August 28.

GameFi projects are drawing in millions of players around the world and will continue to gain popularity, not only with Web3 gamers but also with casual gamers. However, the challenge is how to open Web2 gamers to the industry and all it has to offer.

Game Space CEO – Michael Cameron said that “Transitioning Web2 users to Web3 is a challenge that every company faces and companies need to think about new and innovative ways to overcome this”. Cameron believes Web2 users won’t enter Web3 through an NFT purchase but will instead be exposed to Web3 by acquiring an NFT through an AirDrop which will later open the door for purchasing.

With that said Game Space holding the Steam event has proven this point and there’s no denying Game Space has made strong moves in the GameFi industry in the past month, growing its user volume by almost 400% since July 2022. In the first two weeks of August Game Space recorded over 50,000 downloads and registered Steam-connected users on their Game Space Wallet, They also recently announced support for the Polygon blockchain and started working with other huge partners in the industry.

Also in August Game Space has reported 13,820 active wallets, and the transaction volume on their GameFi NFT Marketplace has increased by over 50%. Seeing this amount of value and growth for Game Space makes the platform interesting for investors. It comes as no surprise that they recently secured $10 million in a Seed investment round with Huobi, Mirana Ventures and other top-tier investment institutions.

Cameron also hinted some information regarding their first AAA Web2 game coming online soon, He mentioned in our interview “Dozens of games are being tested and are integrating GaaS services provided by the Game Space SDK and we have a big announcement that we’re very excited about that we will be dropping very soon” said Cameron.

Game Space is the first GameFi as a Service platform in the whole industry. Through the SDK provided by Game Space, the game or APP of gaming companies can have the same blockchain function as StepN in as little as 7 days of development, including NFT distribution and trading.

Game Space provides a fully functional NFT trading marketplace that supports multi-chain deployment on BSC, ETH, Polygon, Solana, Heco, Flow and many more. Game Space focuses on being a one-stop solution for AAA Web2 gaming studios and titles. It features an NFT marketplace which can be embeddable in games that will help Web2 and Web3 games shorten their launch time by up to six months.

2022-07-05,The Worst Quarter in Bitcoin History - BTC Sees Record -56% Drop in Q2 2022 - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Bitcoin lost 56.23% in the second quarter of this year, which is the largest quarterly price decrease since 2010

The only other quarter that Bitcoin’s price decreased by over 50% was in the first quarter of 2018

Historically, Bitcoin performed the best during the three-month stretches between March and June

Q2 2022 was Bitcoin’s single worst quarterly performance

Bitcoin finished the second quarter of 2022 down roughly 56%, which is the BTC’s single worst quarterly performance since 2010. Historically, Bitcoin gained the most during the second quarters, with an average quarterly price increase of 120% over the past 12 years.

Beyond Q2 results, Bitcoin showed the second biggest gains on average in the fourth quarters, with a roughly 111% price appreciation. On the contrary, the third quarters had historically been Bitcoin’s worst three-month stretches – the world’s largest crypto gained approximately 9% on average during Q3s over the past 13 years.

Bitcoin never lost as much in a single quarter as during Q2 2022.

Looking at historical price data, Q2 2022 is currently ranked as Bitcoin’s worst quarterly result ever. The only other three-month span during which Bitcoin had experienced more than a 50% drop came in Q1 2018.

Bitcoin’s poor Q2 performance was a combination of the macroeconomic slowdown and crypto-specific factors. Interest rate hikes designed to fight growing inflation have had a notable negative impact on the value of expansionary assets, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies included. In addition, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and subsequent liquidity problems of major crypto investment firms have led to a major crypto sell-off. For context, the total cryptocurrency market cap more than halved between March and June 2022, falling from $1.98 trillion to $902 billion in the span of three months.

Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $19,950, more than 70% removed from last November’s all-time high of $68,770.

2022-07-30,Positivity blazing through a bear market: Blockchain Economy Istanbul 2022 - Cointelegraph,"Held at Hilton Bomonti — a fancy hotel next to a renovated and repurposed beer factory in Istanbul — the fourth iteration of the Blockchain Economy Summit 2022 (BE2022) proved to be a significant step-up compared to its pre-pandemic predecessors.

The previous summit, BE2020, was held at the WOW Convention Center two years back. In addition to being situated in a harder-to-reach part of Istanbul, the summit coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak, further impacting the overall attendance. Since the sole purpose of that venue was organizing large-scale events, the crypto community from two years prior was just not big enough to fill the space. As a direct result of the aforementioned factors, the BE2020 felt like a two-day trip to a ghost town.

Attendees of Blockchain Economy Istanbul 2022 described the summit as dense, vivid and full of energy, drawing a stark contrast to the BE2020 in almost every aspect. It was also the first international crypto and blockchain event held in the region ever since Turkey revoked travel ban restrictions. As a result, the crypto community members — from Western and Eastern countries — could join in on the celebration.

The event roster had a good balance between the local companies and global crypto players. While big shots like Binance, Huobi or FTX were visibly absent from the event, logos of major companies like KuCoin, Gate.io, Bitget, Bitmex and Uphold were filling the main hall. Despite its recent troubles, Gari Network donned the main sponsor badge for the whole event.

For two days, the main hall never saw a dull moment: People were there mainly for networking purposes after two years filled with lockdowns and travel bans —and it’s hard to say they missed much by not attending sessions at the main conference stage.

Sure, some exciting names like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor (although he joined via video call) or Davinci Jeremie, the “Please Just Buy One Bitcoin” guy, were on the keynote schedule. But, unfortunately, the program saw greater participation of more local or regional speakers than necessary for an international event of this scale — and the supercooling in the conference room didn’t help either.

People got chilled, lost interest in the simultaneous translation and headed back to the main area where a giant-sized samurai dog statue from the blockchain-based battle royale game Katana Inu welcomed them in an intimidating way. The best part? Most keynote speakers made themselves available for a little chat in the main hall after their stage performances.

Cointelegraph reached out to several keynote speakers for some quick commentary and in-depth conversations, including KuCoin Labs head Lou Yu and AAX exchange executive Ben Caselin.

The BE2022 event was most beneficial for the young and talented developers of the community, of which Turkey houses plenty. During the event, Ali Dursun was able to pitch his blockchain gaming ecosystem Ratic to an array of global exchanges and venture capitals. Aybars Dorman introduced Metavest, a fresh take on decentralized finance (DeFi), to the participants, and Yotta21 founder Yunus Cebeci made important industry contacts at the smoking area.

Two things were clear: First, the COVID-19 pandemic could not slow down the crypto ecosystem’s growth. For many participants, Blockchain Economy Istanbul 2022 was their first networking experience with the rest of the industry, and they thrived in making the most of it. And second, no matter how bearish a crypto market gets, the price fluctuations can’t shake down the positivity of the crypto ecosystem.

Considering everything that transpired during the event, the Blockchain Economy Istanbul 2022 summit solidified that no matter the market conditions, the crypto ecosystem is ready to invest time, money and energy to stay positive.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb3NpdGl2aXR5LWJsYXppbmctdGhyb3VnaC1hLWJlYXItbWFya2V0LWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tZWNvbm9teS1pc3RhbmJ1bC0yMDIy0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Bvc2l0aXZpdHktYmxhemluZy10aHJvdWdoLWEtYmVhci1tYXJrZXQtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1lY29ub215LWlzdGFuYnVsLTIwMjIvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-04,Token-Powered Social Media Platform Taki Opens Its Beta to More than Half a Million Waitlist Users - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

Taki, a social media platform that uses tokenized incentives, has opened its beta

More than half a million users that have signed up to Taki's waitlist can now join the platform

Users can now claim their unique ""usercoins"", which can be traded with others

Taki launches its beta to more than half a million beta users

Taki, a social media platform that implements tokenized incentives for its users, has officially launched its Beta phase. Now, users who have signed up to Taki’s waitlist can sign up to the platform, which was operating in invite-only mode until now. During the beta, Taki aims to gradually onboard more than half a million users from the waitlist.

Taki users can now claim a unique name for their “usercoin”—so far, more than 56,000 usercoins have been generated on the platform. Usercoins represent a user’s social media presence on the Taki platform, and can be traded between users. Per the Taki team, usercoins provide content creators an alternative mechanism for monetizing content without the need to rely on sponsorships.

Holders of a usercoin receive a portion of the “Gold Taki” received by the usercoin’s creator. This introduces some interesting dynamics to the platform—for example, one could purchase usercoins representing a user they believe will grow in popularity in the future.

According to the Taki team, users will be able to earn TAKI token rewards by completing basic daily tasks on the platform during the beta phase. The platform will also support functionality for tracking the performance of their own coin, as well as the other usercoins they own.

Here’s what Sakina Arsiwala, a co-founder of the Taki project, had to say about the platform’s beta launch:

“We have decided to now open up this platform to the public at large so more people can gain benefit from our platform for wealth generation. We are now moving a significant step ahead in our journey embracing the Web3 ethos to make Taki more user-friendly with crypto-native innovations.

Our focus is on establishing a value-generated creators’ platform to help elevate their experience of creating their own personalized token economies. We want to build a source of daily income for our users.”

Taki is primarily concentrating its efforts on the Asian market, with a particular focus on India. The project plans to further its expansion into other markets later this year. So far, Taki has raised $3.45 million in a seed round backed by 11 notable cryptocurrency investment firms, including the likes of Alameda Research, Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures and others.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2NvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzU3MS90b2tlbi1wb3dlcmVkLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1wbGF0Zm9ybS10YWtpLW9wZW5zLWl0cy1iZXRhLXRvLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1oYWxmLWEtbWlsbGlvbi13YWl0bGlzdC11c2Vycy_SAYoBaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTc1NzEvdG9rZW4tcG93ZXJlZC1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtcGxhdGZvcm0tdGFraS1vcGVucy1pdHMtYmV0YS10by1tb3JlLXRoYW4taGFsZi1hLW1pbGxpb24td2FpdGxpc3QtdXNlcnMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-18,Web 3.0 is Slowly Gaining the Attention of Established Brands Looking to Launch in the Metaverse - CoinCodex,"Web 3.0, the latest iteration of the internet, is slowly emerging as a game-changer in today’s digital world. Also dubbed the ‘decentralized web’, it is built on the core principles of openness and autonomy. Ideally, this new version of the internet introduces a web ecosystem that is governed by users instead of centralized entities. While the concept is still in the early stages of innovation, most tech-savvy people have come across one or two Web 3.0 applications.

According to a recent blockchain market report, the Web 3.0 economy was valued at $1.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to hit $87 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 45.20%. Most of this growth can be attributed to the debut of Web 3.0 applications (DApps) in the crypto industry over the past two years. Some of the notable Web 3.0 niches that have popped up include Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse.

More interestingly, the Web 3.0 narrative is now catching up with institutions following the rising popularity of the metaverse. What are the odds that corporations will soon be advertising on virtual ecosystems through blockchain and VR powered technologies? Well, it seems like we are heading there. Big tech firms led by Meta have expressed an interest in the metaverse while others are joining through partnerships with established metaverse platforms.

Earlier this year, Microsoft disclosed plans to acquire U.S based gaming publisher Activision Blizzard in a strategic move to start building their own metaverse. Meanwhile, the price of virtual land on platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox have been skyrocketing, with investors rushing to acquire high end properties. Some of these stakeholders include well known brands such as Adidas, Domino’s and Atari.

“For years, we’ve talked about creating this digital representation of the world, but now, we actually have the opportunity to go into that world and participate in it. What’s most important is that we are able to bring our humanity with us.” noted Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella in a recent keynote.

Web 2.0 Companies and the Metaverse

As the old saying goes, if you can’t beat them, join them; this is the approach that Web 2.0 companies are taking to ensure that they are part of the future. Initially, most of the traditional institutions had chosen to ignore crypto innovations but metaverse is clearly hard to resist. We are now seeing a wave of Web 2.0 companies investing in the metaverse of building their own virtual ecosystems from ground up.

For instance, popular fashion brand Adidas has already purchased land on The Sandbox where they will be showcasing exclusive content and experiences. While physical stores are still the primary sales avenues, Adidas’ presence on the metaverse means that more people can sample their products given the ease of accessing virtual worlds. Coca-Cola has also joined the bandwagon, having launched an NFT collection in collaboration with Decentraland.

Looking at these developments, the trend is becoming more apparent; virtual worlds will eventually become part of everyday life. Today, it is possible to earn a passive income by creating your own fashion brand through the Fashion League. Both individual players and brands can curate customized clothing stores, alongside participating in design competitions within a virtual and permissionless ecosystem.

Besides the luxury market, gaming publishers are also adopting Web 3.0 infrastructures; recently, Ubisoft partnered with Animoca brands to experiment NFT games on The Sandbox. In fact, a good number of stakeholders in the traditional gaming market believe that introducing decentralized economies for in-game items would be a double kill for the gaming community. They get to enjoy the experience while earning some extra coins.

On the development front, we have Web 3.0 platforms such as Looking Glass Labs (LGL) that are focusing on bridging the integration gap. At the core, LGL specializes in designing NFT architecture, immersive metaverse environments and play-to-earn models. Institutions that find it hard to launch Web 3.0 innovations can leverage LGL’s expertise to make a seamless debut into the metaverse.

That said, Web 3.0 has a massive scaling potential given its value proposition in a world where most interactions happen online. Speaking to CNBC, Mark Zuckerberg recently said that the metaverse will likely become a big part of the digital economy,

“We hope to basically get to around a billion people in the metaverse doing hundreds of dollars of commerce, each buying digital goods, digital content, and different things to express themselves.”

Conclusion

Despite the criticisms from regulators and tradfi diehards, the metaverse is here to stay. However, there might be a few changes to tackle existing limitations such as interoperability and user experience. These can only be addressed through the collaboration of Web 2.0 companies and crypto natives who believe in the possibility of decentralized virtual worlds. Only then will the metaverse be a complete concept.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2NvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xODA3OS93ZWItMzAtaXMtc2xvd2x5LWdhaW5pbmctdGhlLWF0dGVudGlvbi1vZi1lc3RhYmxpc2hlZC1icmFuZHMtbG9va2luZy10by1sYXVuY2gtaW4tdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS_SAYcBaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgwNzkvd2ViLTMwLWlzLXNsb3dseS1nYWluaW5nLXRoZS1hdHRlbnRpb24tb2YtZXN0YWJsaXNoZWQtYnJhbmRzLWxvb2tpbmctdG8tbGF1bmNoLWluLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2Uv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-08-02,Ethereum burn rate at ATL: Here's why it's concerning - Watcher Guru,"Ethereum’s EIP-155 upgrade went live last year. The improvement proposal significantly changed Ethereum’s monetary policy and introduced the whole burning mechanism.

Post the upgrade, even though burning was implemented, ETH’s price did not react to it immediately. More so because the issuance was higher than that of the burning rate. However, on a couple of occasions when the burning rate has accelerated, ETH has noted minor relief upticks simultaneously. At the moment, however, things are a bit haywire.

Ethereum burning rate at an ATL

Before stepping into the burning rate, it is essential to note that Ethereum gas prices have dropped to around 17.5 gwei. As illustrated in the chart below, this is the lowest network congestion and gas price since May 2020. A low gas fee usually means fewer people are using the network and vice versa. Elaborating on the current state, Glassnode’s latest weekly report noted,

“This signals that despite recent positive price action, there has not been an influx of new usage, and overall, the Ethereum is at a multi-year low in relative activity.”

Here it is essential to note that with every transaction on the network, a small amount of ETH [the base fee] is removed out of circulation via burning. The burn rate has hit, with the network usage remaining low.

As depicted in the chart below, the ETH burn rate via EIP1559 currently stands at an all-time low, implying that ETH is the least deflationary ever since last year’s upgrade went live. Glassnode revealed,

“Total ETH burned is now just 11% of the total issuance.”

The situation continues to remain lackluster. According to Watch The Burn’s latest data, only 1301 ETH tokens have been burned over the past day, relative to the 12,352 tokens brought into circulation. The net reduction, as a result, stood at merely 9.53% at press time.

Price implication

Well, the current state of affairs w.r.t. burning and issuance points to the fact that the circulating supply is on the rise, making the landscape unfavorable for the price to incline. Market participants have also been selling their tokens, adding fuel to the fire. Per data from ITB, over the past 6 hours alone, the sell-side tokens have exceeded the buy-side by 20.84k ETH.

The price has been reacting to the same. Ethereum has lost the most value over the past 24 hours relative to its top-10 peers. After depreciating by almost 7% on the daily window, ETH was trading at $1575 at press time. And, if the network activity doesn’t improve, the burn rate remains stagnated, and the sell-pressure intensifies, then the price dip will likely continue.

2022-07-19,What to Look for when Buying NFTs on Binance NFT? - CoinCodex,"Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs for short, have turned out to be one of the most interesting innovations enabled by blockchain technology. While the potential applications of NFTs are almost limitless, the tech has quickly found a product-market fit for digital artworks and collectibles.

Even though the poor performance of the crypto market in 2022 has also slowed down interest for NFTs, the market has shown an impressive level of resilience—for now, it certainly looks like NFTs are here to stay and weren’t just a phenomenon of the 2020-2021 cryptocurrency bull market.

NFTs first started gaining traction on the Ethereum blockchain, which is where the technology originated – projects like CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties were some of the first examples of using NFTs to represent unique digital collectibles. The OpenSea marketplace emerged as a clear leader in the NFT marketplace sector, but the number of competitors is growing quickly. For example, many established cryptocurrency exchanges have implemented NFT trading into their product offerings.

Binance NFT is a fully-featured NFT marketplace created by Binance

One of the most prominent examples of this is Binance NFT, which is an NFT marketplace launched by the Binance cryptocurrency exchange in 2022. Binance NFT currently supports NFTs issued on the Ethereum and BNB Chain blockchain platforms.

Explore NFTs on Binance

In this article, we’ll be taking a look at how you can use Binance NFT to explore and purchase NFTs. The platform has implemented numerous features since its launch that make it easy to find NFTs that are relevant to you and filter out the “noise” you’re not interested in.

Interested in Binance NFT? here's what you need to know

Let’s explain some of the most important concepts associated with NFT collections that you can find on Binance NFT. This will help you get a better perspective on the NFTs and collections you’re evaluating, and how they stack up against the market. We’ll be using the Rh!noX NFT collection as an an example to make the explanation clearer—please note that this is not an endorsement or investment advice.

Floor price

The concept of a “floor price” is used very commonly in the NFT community. The floor price of an NFT collection simply tells you the lowest price an NFT from the collection can currently be purchased for. We can see that the current floor price of the Rh!noX collection on the Binance NFT marketplace is 849 USD. When it comes to algorithmically generated collections like Rh!noX, you’ll typically find that NFTs with more common traits tend to have a lower price. NFTs with rarer traits tend to be farther removed from the collection’s floor price.

Ceiling price

As the name suggests, the ceiling price is the opposite of the floor price. The ceiling price refers to the highest price an NFT from a collection is currently being sold for. The ceiling price is usually less useful as a metric than the floor price, as NFT owners will sometimes list their NFTs for sale at unrealistically high prices.

Estimated market cap

Unlike with standard crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s not really possible to provide an accurate market cap figure for an NFT collection. This is because different NFTs from a collection have different prices (which also depend on the specific owner), and not all NFTs from a collection are on sale at any given moment.

However, we can calculate an estimate of an NFT’s collection’s market cap, which can help us gauge how valuable it is compared to other NFT collections. You can get an estimate by multiplying the collection’s 7-day average trading price with the total number of NFTs in the collection.

Supply

The supply of a NFT collection is the total number of NFTs that are part of that collection. In the case of the Rh!noX collection, the supply is 1337 NFTs. When considering a collection’s floor price, it’s also worth taking into account the number of NFTs in the collection—the concept is similar to evaluating a cryptocurrency based on the price of a single unit and the size of the total supply. On Binance NFT, you can see a collection’s supply in the “Items” section.

Rarity

When it comes to PFP (profile picture) NFTs like Rh!noX, every NFT in the collection is typically unique—no two NFTs in the collection are identical. Therefore, the concept of “rarity” can be a bit confusing at first glance. Usually, when NFT collectors talk about rarity, they talk about the rarity of the traits displayed on a particular NFT.

Some traits are rarer than others, which means that they appear on fewer NFTs in the collection. NFTs with rare traits will often fetch a higher price than NFTs with more common traits, but this is not always the case.

For NFT collections that support this feature, you can filter NFTs from the collection based on their traits. You can do so in the “Properties” section under “Filters”. In our example, we’re filtering for Rh!noX NFTs that have the “Universe” fur trait.

You can also apply multiple trait filters at a time, but you might end up with no results—an NFT with the specific combination of traits you’re looking for might not exist.

Trading volume

The trading volume metric tells you the volume of sales for an NFT collection in a given time period. If a collection has a lot of trading volume, that indicates that there is a substantial amount of interest for the project. You can view the trading volume rankings of different projects on Binance NFT in the marketplace’s “Ranking” section.

Buying NFTs on Binance NFT

If you want to buy an NFT on Binance NFT, there’s a couple of different ways to go about it. If you already know the collection you’re interested in, you can simply find it using the search bar and then browse the NFTs using the filter system.

NFTs that are already listed with a fixed price can be purchased immediately at the listed price. Sometimes, NFTs aren’t listed with a fixed price, but are instead put on auction. Here’s an example of a Rh!noX NFT that’s on auction with the current highest bid of 1,500 BUSD. If you wanted to purchase this particular NFT, you’d have to submit a higher bid and hope that nobody would outbid you before the end of the auction.

If you’re looking for a more detailed guide on the process of buying NFTs on Binance NFT, you can find one on Binance’s official website.

Collections listed on Binance NFT are divided into two groups—Premier and Standard. Premier collections are created in collaboration with the Binance NFT platform, and you can easily identify them by the orange tick next to their name. Meanwhile, Standard collections haven’t been verified by Binance NFT. If you’re just getting started with NFTs and don’t have much experience with the market, it might be a good idea to narrow down your search to Premier collections only.

You can also quickly scan projects based on their trading volume, floor price, supply, and number of sales. This is useful to identify active projects that are currently enjoying a lot of interest from NFT collectors and traders.

If you go to the NFT Rankings section of the Marketplace, you can easily find NFT collections with the most sales, as well as the NFT creators whose NFTs are seeing the most trading volume.

If you just want to collect NFTs and keep them without any intentions of selling them later, metrics like trading volume and sales might not be important to you. However, if you plan to sell your NFT at a later date, it’s a good idea to stick to projects that have strong trading volume and sales activity—otherwise, it might be difficult to find someone that’s willing to buy your NFT from you. Since all NFTs are different, the liquidity in the NFT markets is much lower than the liquidity in the markets for coins like BTC, ETH and BNB.

The bottom line

Binance NFT is a fully-featured NFT marketplace that gives you plenty of tools to find the NFT projects you’re interested in. The platform supports a multitude of filtering and search options, which makes it easy to filter among the NFTs within a single collection, or compare different NFT collections with each other. Another useful feature are “Premier” collections, which are verified by Binance NFT.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE2OTU5L3doYXQtdG8tbG9vay1mb3Itd2hlbi1idXlpbmctbmZ0cy1vbi1iaW5hbmNlLW5mdC_SAVhodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNjk1OS93aGF0LXRvLWxvb2stZm9yLXdoZW4tYnV5aW5nLW5mdHMtb24tYmluYW5jZS1uZnQv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-02,Aurigami Collects $12M Warchest to Grow Aurora-Based Lending Protocol - Yahoo Finance,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates--(Newsfile Corp. - August 2, 2022) - Aurigami, a lending protocol with currently the third largest TVL on Aurora, has raised a total of $12M in a combination of private and public sale.





Aurigami $12M Fundraise

The private part of the raised includes $9.5M, collected from a large number of major venture funds. The round was co-led by Dragonfly Capital and Polychain Capital. Other funds who joined include Mechanism Capital, Amber Group, Coinbase Ventures, Jump Crypto, Alameda Research, Lemniscap and others.

Several prominent angels also joined, such as Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora; Julian Koh, Co-Founder of Ribbon; Bobby Ong & TM Lee, CoinGecko Co-Founders; Alex Svanevik, Nansen; Etherscan's Matthew Tan; and Santiago R. Santos.

A later Initial Exchange Offering on Kucoin, Bybit and Impossible Finance saw 5% of total supply sold for $2.5M. All raises were conducted by offering PLY, the governance token of the Aurigami platform.

Aurigami is an overcollateralized lending platform allowing users to supply crypto assets and borrow them to obtain leverage. Unlike similar protocols, Aurigami places heavy emphasis on gamification. One of its key innovations is the concept of ""Locked Liquid Tokens"" (LLT), which allows the project to attract liquidity without creating instant selling pressure. PULP, the LLT for PLY, is a token that acts as a claim of PLY in the future.

The $12M raise grants Aurigami a sizable treasury and runway to continue developing the platform, including expanding on the LLT concept and driving Aurora ecosystem growth such as promoting adoption of NEAR's USN stablecoin.

""We're glad to have raised this combined $12M to help support us in building the platform through this crypto winter,"" said Lucas Huang, Co-Founder of Aurigami. ""With the combined support from the world class investors, and the amazing communities who joined our public sale, we're here to bring LLTs and gamified DeFi to Aurora users.""

2022-08-15,Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding for Artists—Interview with Corite CEO Mattias Tengblad - CoinCodex,"Interview with Corite CEO Mattias Tengblad

We recently had the opportunity to talk to Mattias Tengblad, the CEO and co-founder of Corite. Corite is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that allows fans to support their favorite artists and share in their success when the music is released. Before we continue, we'd like to thank him for taking the time to share his thoughts on crowdfunding and how it can be improved through blockchain technology.

How did Corite's story start? What do you think led to the creation of the project?

Prior to starting Corite, I spent 20+ years working in various industries that were transformed by the digital revolution and the internet: telecom, video games, content production, and also the music industry. At Universal Music Group, I was part of a team that launched Digster (playlist streaming service) and Spinnup (a music distribution platform). Around 2017, I became interested in crypto and blockchain. As I learned more about smart contracts, it became clear to me that there was a lot of potential in combining music production and distribution with the world of crypto.

When did you first hear about blockchain? What about its concept convinced you that it could be used to help the music and media businesses grow?

While I was somewhat aware of Bitcoin beforehand, the explosion of interest around Ethereum in 2017 was when I really became interested and started to learn more about blockchain. As I learned more about it, I realized that people could transact value across borders without having to trust each other while also entering into an agreement via a smart contract. This setup is really ideal for crowdfunding directly between fans and artists because it removes friction in the payment process while also protecting the fan’s interest by automatically enforcing the terms of the agreement.

According to statistics, around 78% of campaigns fall short of their funding goals. What do you believe is the primary cause of failure?

In many cases, I believe there is a need for more awareness and marketing, but also the funding goals need to be realistic. End users need to be given as much information as possible so they can feel confident in contributing. A big part of our platform is to provide these things. For example, we often use our social media channels to bring attention to new artists and campaigns that are opening up. Also, we designed the platform to give clear information to potential backers—streaming goals, expected returns, information about the artist and their previous track record, etc. We also advise artists about how much they should try to raise, and while it is ultimately up to them, we have found a lot of success in getting campaigns funded when the goals are reasonable and users are provided with clear information.

Why do you believe traditional crowdfunding needs to be improved in order to be effective for projects and individuals? What are the main problems you see with its mechanism?

To me, the most important things are transparency and enforceability. People need to know what they can expect in exchange for their contribution. I think our platform is very strong in this regard—people know how long they are entitled to streaming revenue for, they can see exactly what portion of the revenue they are entitled to, and due to the use of smart contracts and NFTs, everything is recorded and accounted for in a very transparent way.

Which kind of project do you think blockchain crowdfunding works best and easiest for? Is blockchain crowdfunding helpful for boosting business growth in developing markets?

Well, unsurprisingly, I am sure blockchain crowdfunding is really well suited to music! However, it can apply equally well to anything that produces something that can in turn produce value. I think a model like this could also be used to great effect for movie production, general-interest YouTube channels, and similar things.

The whole concept has a lot of potential to boost growth in developing markets, because mainstream sources of funding like record labels and production studios may not be looking in these places for potential sources of content. If the funding process were passed to the general public at large, it would really unlock the capital available in any geographic region.

Blockchain is an intriguing concept, but will most people be able to trust it with their money in today's uncertain economy?

Like all new technology, it takes time for people to get comfortable and for the technology to become ""second nature."" We will see adoption from older users who are used to legacy systems, but the real growth will come in the long term as younger people who grow up knowing about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, NFTs, etc. become adults.

A lot of people’s distrust of blockchain is tied to a lack of understanding. The more people grow to understand the importance of self-custody and learn how to identify scams and bad actors, the less stigma will exist around blockchain and cryptocurrency as something which is unsafe or not to be trusted.

How does Corite assist users in avoiding unnecessary risks when using blockchain? Or is it up to investors to keep themselves safe from scammers?

If someone is transacting directly on our platform, they can have peace of mind knowing that all available campaigns are backed by our smart contract design and that the terms of the campaign will be enforced. In addition, we vet the artists who apply to our platform, which filters out bad actors who would raise funds with no intention of producing and marketing the best quality music that they can. I think it’s also important to have all our brand’s official social media channels, Telegram channels, etc. listed on our website and remind people to only get information from official sources.

As I discussed above, however, there is a personal responsibility inherent in dealing with cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency wallets, and Web3 in general. While we can take several steps to protect users within the confines of our platform, we obviously can’t protect people from accessing a fake website, or fake Telegram groups, or using poor security practices in guarding their private keys, etc. So in general, I think there are responsibilities on both sides.

The way blockchain-based crowdfunding works seems good for users and artists, but how do platforms benefit from this?

Speaking from experience, one of the best things about blockchain transactions is the traceability and reliability of the records they create. Our platform is designed as a hybrid Web2/Web3 system, meaning users have a choice of using traditional payment methods such as PayPal or cryptocurrency. Administering the Web2 side of our operation is often more complicated than the crypto side, as we are responsible for ensuring the integrations are working properly, ensuring that accurate records are kept, dealing with settlement lag, and things like this. Crypto transactions, on the other hand, have an instant settlement, automatically create reliable transaction logs on the blockchain, and we don’t have to worry about the underlying functionality of the payment network.

In terms of profits, one NFT drop can differ from another. We take a percentage based on what services we provide which typically is somewhere between 10-30%. If there's a music release tied to the NFT, we typically charge 5% which is our distribution fee.

Under what circumstances can we expect existing crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or Patreon to migrate to the blockchain? Should traditional crowdfunding continue to exist as an alternative to blockchain now that cryptocurrencies can be purchased globally?

Well, both Kickstarter and Patreon have already announced plans to integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency in the long term. However, I do think that traditional methods will persist on these platforms as well. As mentioned previously, Corite also has a hybrid model, which I feel will be the standard for many platforms for the foreseeable future. People often want to view these things as a binary ""one or the other"" option, but this is generally not how things work. For example, many people now receive paperless E-bills for their cell phone bills, power bills, etc., but those who still want to be mailed an old-school paper bill every month have that option. This whole process will mirror that; it won’t be a sudden 180-degree change.

What do you think about Vitalik’s proposal from a few years back in the ICO craze – DAICO?

It’s a good idea in general, and we should always consider ways to protect users on both sides of a crypto transaction when possible. Really, his whole idea comes down to accountability: if I contribute value to you, what guarantee do I have that you will hold up your end of the deal? And what happens if you don’t? Addressing questions like these in an automated and transparent way is, to me, at the heart of what smart contracts are all about.

Last question: what do you think the price of Bitcoin will be at the end of 2022?

Just based on the headwinds faced in markets this year and the pressure that was put on Bitcoin through the failure of some major protocols, I am leaning towards the worst being behind us. So I’ll just go ahead and throw out a conservatively optimistic number: $32,562. You heard it here first!

KLEX Mainnet to drive greater capital efficiency in the Klaytn ecosystem

Klex Finance, an automated portfolio management protocol running on the Klaytn blockchain, launched the KLEX mainnet on Friday. The highly anticipated mainnet launch, which came off the heels of a successful testnet run earlier this month, will allow the users of the Klaytn network to tap into DeFi liquidity via weighted liquidity pools, stablecoin pools, and pools designed to facilitate the launch of new tokes on the network.

The broader blockchain community's interest in the KLEX platform, and the overarching Klaytn ecosystem, reached a new level following this year's Korea Blockchain Week, one of the most coveted annual events in the crypto space.

KLEX is Balancer-like decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol running atop the EVM-compatible Klaytn blockchain. One of the unique features of the new DeFi trading protocol is the ability of users to participate in pools that consist of up to 8 different coins and different coin weightings. This comes in stark contrast to most automated market makers (AMMs) in the space, which typically rely on pools that are split in a 50/50 fashion between two digital assets.

The team shared the news of the successful KLEX mainnet launch on Twitter:

- The first 3 incentivized pools are boosted stablecoin pools!

- Boosted weighted pools for KLAY and other variables assets are coming soon.

- Pre-mining starts NOW — ? Klex ? (@klexfinance) August 26, 2022

Klaytn is a rapidly growing layer 1 chain, which has $324 million in KLAY locked in various DeFi products and services running on its rails, according to data from DeFi Llama. The most popular dApp on the network is currently the AMM-based instant swap protocol KlaySwap, which accounts for roughly 61% of all TVL on the network.

The Klex Finance team aims to attract KlaySwap users – and users of other decentralized applications (dApps) on the Klaytn network – to its platform via a series of exclusive promotions and unique features.

The KLEX team is commemorating the mainnet launch with a pre-mining rewards program

The Klex Finance team has allocated $680,000 in KLAY (the native token of the Klaytn network) and 9.5 million KLEX (soon-to-be-launched governance token of Klex Finance) for pre-miners. The pre-mining campaign will run for up to 1 month and will see participants earn KLAY and KLEX across the following seven incentivized pools:

Synapse USDT / USDC / DAI Stable Pool

Wormhole USDT / USDC / DAI Stable Pool

Synapse USDT / Wormhole USDT / Orbit USDT Stable Pool

Wormhole USDT / WBTC / ETH (33% Weighted Pool)

WKLAY / WBTC / ETH / BNB / AVAX (20% Weighted Pool)

WKLAY / USDT (20% / 80% Weighted Pool)

WKLAY / USDT (80% / 20% Weighted Pool)

The reason for the incentivized pre-mining program is to grow liquidity as fast as possible, both to increase the protocol’s revenue and achieve a higher degree of capital efficiency through low slippage.

Each of the eligible pre-mining pools will have a cap, ranging from $2.5 million to $5 million, above which users will still be able to contribute liquidity to the pools, however, they will no longer be eligible to earn pre-mining rewards.

KLEX allocated KLAY and KLEX crypto rewards for the liquidity migration campaign

To support liquidity migration from KlaySwap (briefly mentioned in the first section of the article), KLEX will start a promotion – aptly called KLEX Raid – which will allow users to deposit KlaySwap pool tokens to earn a share of $600,000 in KLAY and 15 million KLEX tokens. If we assume a $0.10 valuation for KLEX, that’s more than $2 million in total rewards.

The promotion starts in a week and will include the following pools:

oUSDT / KDAI LP

oUSDT / oUSDC

KLAY / oUSDT

KLAY / oETH

oETH / oUSDT

Like pre-mining pools, the migration pools will also be capped to incentivize early participation.

KLEX lockdrop and token launch

After the KLEX raid, the next step on Klex Finance’s roadmap will be to launch the KLEX lockdrop, a campaign designed to lock liquidity for 3 months in the same pools that will be eligible for pre-mining rewards.

A series of exclusive promotions and incentive programs will culminate with the launch of the KLEX token. KLEX will be launched via Klex Finance’s own Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.

Currently, the team has not shared any information about the exact KLEX launch date. However, they did reveal that the exact launch date will be shared with the broader crypto community at the end of September.

2022-08-24,Explained: Crypto OTC trading and how it works - CNBCTV18,"Crypto exchanges have popped up all around the world. Today, we have large trading platforms that operate globally, such as Binance, KuCoin and FTX. We also have domestic exchanges in India, like UnoCoin, WazirX and CoinDCX.

While these exchanges are great for regular investors, they fall short for whales that operate in large sums. In this article, we learn about a highly sought-after alternative to traditional exchanges that high-volume traders often turn to, known as over the counter (OTC) trading.

What is crypto OTC trading?

Over the counter (OTC) trading refers to trading via agencies or people that carry out your transactions for you, isolated from regular exchanges. In simple terms, if you want to avoid purchasing, trading or selling crypto via mainstream, severely regulated exchanges, you can opt for OTC trading, which provides privacy, higher transaction limits and a getaway from market fluctuations.

How does over-the-counter trading work?

There is no set method for OTC trading. The only constant is the lack of a user interface, which is common across regular exchanges. Over-the-counter trades often happen through trust, where a requirement is posted, a quote is given, negotiations undertaken and then finally, upon agreement of all parties, the transaction is completed.

At times, there is just one person who acts as a third party, and when it comes to larger sums, an agency may take over the workload to bring together buyers and sellers. OTC agencies that facilitate trading also have their own reserves to ensure urgent liquidity in terms of fiat and other major cryptocurrencies.

The process of signing up for OTC trading is easy as well as challenging. Easy because there are many OTC agencies available across geographies, challenging because it all depends on trust - you should be able to trust someone with enormous amounts of crypto not to cheat you. Fortunately, many mainstream crypto exchanges offer an OTC desk that will allow you to trade large amounts of crypto without breaking a sweat.

Advantages of OTC Trading

Direct Transactions: When you trade over the counter, you buy crypto directly from the seller or sell directly to the buyer. This eliminates third parties (like exchanges) that drum up the asset's price. This is why you do not get crypto at the rates listed on Google, as exchanges add their expenses to the price.

Negotiation - When was the last time you could negotiate prices through an exchange? It is not allowed. The most you can do is set price alerts and buy or sell options at a price of your liking. With OTC trading, you are buying directly from the seller, so you have the option to negotiate a price dependent on external factors to reach an agreement.

Avoiding Fluctuations: When someone buys 1,000 BTC at an exchange, it is likely to take hours for the transaction to go through. Meanwhile, regular audiences get wind of the trade and start buying BTC too. This will cause a spike in the token price, resulting in the whale getting less BTC than intended. This is a phenomenon known as slippage.

With OTC trades, you negotiate and decide on a price and sell or buy every last one of the tokens at the same price. Because the market is unlikely to be aware of the transactions, it won't affect the token's price.

The disadvantage of OTC trading

The disadvantages of OTC trading are few but mighty, starting with trust. Popular exchanges have oversight from authorities that eliminates the chance of rug pulls and cheating, but the OTC trades are entirely unregulated. There is no chance of someone getting back their funds if the OTC agent decides to cheat and run away after you've trusted them with your money or assets.

Conclusion

In all fairness, there are legitimate OTC agencies trusted by whales and have operated for years. It is always sensible to be cautious and conduct diligent research before you lay your trust in an OTC agency.

2022-08-16,Celsius's Alex Mashinsky Reportedly Took Reign Over the ... - Watcher Guru,"With almost $4 billion in customer debt, Celsius filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy back in July. Over the last month, the firm has been the subject of many investigations, including those by Canadian officials.

Crypto lending companies were at the epicenter of the 2022 crypto market meltdown. Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, and Celsius Network were among the most severely impacted. Even though the market seems to have recovered slightly, the firms are still swimming in troubled waters.

As per reports from the Financial Times, Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky took over the trading strategy and control of his firm. The takeover was reportedly done in January by Alex, citing the reason of a US Federal Reserve meeting that was upcoming.

Celsius suffered over $50 million in losses in January alone

According to unidentified people acquainted with the situation, Mashinsky was concerned that the Fed would raise interest rates and opted to ignore experienced traders with decades of expertise.

Bankrupt Celsius Network CEO reportedly sold hundreds of millions worth of #Bitcoin from users funds and bought it back a day later at loss. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 16, 2022

As per the reports, he directed the crypto lender’s trading staff to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin, and the business purchased the assets back the next day at a loss. According to the report, Celsius lost $50 million in trading in January alone, following the Fed’s plans to hike rates that affected the crypto markets.

“He was ordering the traders to massively trade the book off of bad information.” “He was slugging around huge chunks of bitcoin,” one of the sources said.

It was also reported that Van Etten, a former chief investment officer of Celsius, had disagreements with Mashinsky that led Van to leave the firm in February. Both of them had arguments regarding the decisions made with trading strategies.

Celsius’s lawyers were of the view that the firm’s bankruptcy was mainly due to the collapse of crypto prices rather than mismanagement by the firm. From a company that was valued at $3 billion in December 2021, Celsius dropped to the level of bankruptcy and debt.

Celsius also had GBTC holdings and was also offered a chance to cut the losses and exit the position. But according to the people familiar with the matter, Alex blocked the sale and the losses grew to $125 million.

It seems like the allegations against Celsius and Alex are piling up and it is unclear whether the firm can swim back to the shore.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvY2Vsc2l1c3MtYWxleC1tYXNoaW5za3ktcmVwb3J0ZWRseS10b29rLXJlaWduLW92ZXItdGhlLWNvbXBhbnlzLXRyYWRpbmctc3RyYXRlZ3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-07-06,"Voyager Crypto files for Bankruptcy - Those Crypto Companies are ... - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News","As the crypto market sinks, many crypto companies take a heavy hit from the falling crypto prices. The biggest issue that they mostly face is a significant decrease in their cash flow, making them unable to pay their fixed expenses. A snowball effect occurs rendering those companies broke, and in turn, filing for bankruptcy. Voyager crypto lately filed for bankruptcy in the midst of the crypto crash. This isn’t the first company to do so, as 3 Arrows and Celsius already are knee-deep in their chapter 11 bankruptcy. What happened to Voyager crypto and which other crypto companies are risky?

What is Voyager Crypto?

Voyager crypto is a mobile app on both Android and iOS. It allows users to buy, sell, and stake more than 100 cryptos. The company has its own token called the Voyager Token (VGX), allowing its holders to maximize their earnings with no lockups. The project started back in 2018 and was incorporated in the United States.

Voyager Crypto files for Bankruptcy – What Happened?

The Fall of 3 Arrows Capital

After the fall of 3 Arrows, many other crypto companies got affected. 3 Arrows Capital was a cryptocurrency hedge fund based in Singapore. It started back in 2012 during the very early rise of the crypto market. The company had significant exposure to different kinds of cryptos and was very risky. However, due to the previous bull runs, the company took previous price actions to project their “worst-case scenario”. Surprisingly, the latest crypto crash was among the heaviest, affecting the cash flow of the company.

As 3 Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy, it missed its payments on its loans. When you miss paying other companies, those other companies also get hit. One of those companies happens to be Voyager Digital, which missed payments that total around $650 million.

Voyager tried to withstand the 3AC hit

In turn, Voyager’s cash flow got affected. Voyager first sent an email to all its investors, saying that they had to halt all trading activities, withdrawals, and deposits. All the Voyager debit cards stopped working, in addition to their loyalty rewards. The company did not disclose at first what was going to happen, as they said that they were in heavy discussions on how to “fix things”, leaving investors hanging.

Users received newsletters regarding the suspension decision, and as you might have guessed, were not too happy about it.

Voyager Files for Bankruptcy

3 days after that incident, Voyager announced that they filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. To soften the blow, the company used the term “Protection to Implement Restructuring to maximize value for all stakeholders”. All users of the platform can only access the apps in “view mode” only. They can see their portfolios and the latest crypto prices. Other than that, they can only wait until the lawsuit against 3AC finishes, then for the liquidation of the company to happen. After that, they can only hope to receive some form of compensation depending on their balance on the platform.

Voyagers, today we began a voluntary financial restructuring process to protect assets on the platform, maximize value for all stakeholders, especially customers, and emerge as a stronger company. Voyager will continue operating throughout.https://t.co/TxlO4eua8E — Stephen Ehrlich (@Ehrls15) July 6, 2022

Which Crypto Companies are RISKY?

Following this event, the crypto community started to throw names of well-known crypto exchanges that might also follow the path of Voyager. Here’s a list of all those companies.

KuCoin: A lot of users are already circulating news that KuCoin is insolvent, and are spreading news in the crypto community. However, KuCoin issued a public notice about how confident they are in withstanding the situation and how well-capitalized they are. Vauld: Vauld is another crypto exchange that halted its trading operations, withdrawals, and deposits. The very first scenario of Voyager is happening to this company. There are talks that Nexo is looking to acquire Vauld during their crisis. Coinbase: Another news surfaced in the crypto community about Coinbase selling its users’ private information to the FBI and to ICE. While this is not news about insolvency, it made investors wonder whether the company was in need of additional cash inflows to sustain its activities. Also, Coinbase recently fired more than 1,100 of its staff while its stock tumbled by more than 70%.

Is it RISKY when Crypto Companies suspend Withdrawal?

It is not uncommon for crypto companies to halt trading activities and withdrawals on their platform. This usually happens when the crypto market is highly volatile, whether movements were up or even down. Downward trends create high selling pressure and affect crypto companies that are highly leveraged. Just as for the average trader, using high leverage will definitely take a heavy toll on your bottom line.

Binance is one of the leading crypto exchange currently. They too halted trading operations and withdrawals in certain markets as the crypto market turned volatile. However, this happens for short hours only, and the trading activity continues soon afterward.

Maybe it’s time to Consider using Hardware Wallets?

The safest method to preserve your cryptos would be hands down owning a private hardware wallet. Not only will you have complete ownership over your cryptos, but you’ll be able to hedge all risks that are associated with centralized or decentralized exchanges, such as bankruptcy, hackings, phishing, and keeping your info private.

You might want to consider owning a Trezor or Ledger wallet!

2022-07-20,EarthFund Is Launching a DAO to Fight Climate Change by Funding Carbon Removal Projects - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

EarthFund is launching the Carbon Removal DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that will be funding carbon removal projects

The Carbon Removal DAO was founded by environmental scientist Dr. Lucy Tweed

The DAO plans to support carbon removal projects that emphasize the needs of the local population

EarthFund is launching the Carbon Removal DAO founded by Dr. Lucy Tweed

The EarthFund platform is adding a new DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) dedicated to fighting climate change. The EarthFund platform is designed to support different Causes which operate through their own DAOs. The latest addition is called the Carbon Removal DAO, and is dedicated to funding a variety of carbon removal projects.

The Carbon Removal DAO was founded by Dr. Lucy Tweed, an environmental scientist that’s starting her role as an associate climate researcher at Cambridge University. Here’s what she had to say about the unique proposition that Carbon Removal DAO brings to the table:

“The problem is that there hasn’t been a tool for collective, meaningful, and coordinated global action until now. The Carbon Removal cause is an accessible and inclusive community where people can come together as a collective to support sustainable community-led carbon removal projects and bring about real change.”

The Carbon Removal DAO aims to fund carbon removal projects that take into account the needs of local populations. According to the DAO, many carbon removal projects are primarily focused on generating good PR for corporate players instead of putting the environment first. As an example, the Carbon Removal DAO mentions tree planting projects that don’t take into account the local ecology, and disregard how they will affect the local population.

Instead, Dr. Lucy Tweed says that the DAO will focus on funding carbon removal projects that “put local livelihoods and environmental justice front and center”. She continued by explaining that while individual action against climate change is important, broader systemic change needs to be driven through coordinated action.

Adam Boalt, the CEO of EarthFund, also commented on the upcoming launch of the Carbon Removal DAO:

“We’re all incredibly excited for Dr Tweed to be launching her cause on our platform. Not only is she going to be conducting research into carbon storage at Cambridge University, but through her cause on the EarthFund platform, she’s also going to be growing a global community that gets rewarded for being the driving force behind finding and funding carbon removal projects around the world.”

According to EarthFund, community members will receive an airdrop of CarbonCommon tokens on July 27. While users won’t be able to trade CarbonCommon tokens on the open market, they’ll be able to use the tokens to vote on proposals in the Carbon Removal DAO and join an exclusive online community. CarbonCommon tokens will be swappable for EarthFund’s 1Earth token, and users making significant contributions to the DAO will be rewarded with USDT.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE3MDE3L2VhcnRoZnVuZC1pcy1sYXVuY2hpbmctYS1kYW8tdG8tZmlnaHQtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYnktZnVuZGluZy1jYXJib24tcmVtb3ZhbC1wcm9qZWN0cy_SAX9odHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzAxNy9lYXJ0aGZ1bmQtaXMtbGF1bmNoaW5nLWEtZGFvLXRvLWZpZ2h0LWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWJ5LWZ1bmRpbmctY2FyYm9uLXJlbW92YWwtcHJvamVjdHMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-08-17,"DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) Anticipates Metaverse Platform Launch with Listings on Coinbase, Huobi, and MEXC - Yahoo Finance","Bucharest, Romania --News Direct-- DeFi Yield Protocol

DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) announced listings on several industry-leading exchanges, including Coinbase, Huobi Global, and MEXC. This is just one of the many developments in the project’s fast-paced evolution, including its upcoming Metaverse platform, where users will get to interact with Cats and Watches Society (CAWS) NFTs. Moreover, DYP took center stage at Deep Forest Fest. During this prestigious music festival, DYPians had the great opportunity of meeting the team.

The DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) is enhancing the list of reputable crypto exchanges listing its DYP token. On June 21, Coinbase disclosed its listing of DYP, while trading started the next day. Later, on July 19, MEXC announced its listing of DYP. Lastly, on July 27, it was Huobi that added DYP to its platform.

DYP supporters, a.k.a. DYPians, can purchase DYP tokens at these major exchanges but also on smaller platforms, including KuCoin, Gate, Poloniex, Bitrue, ZT, Hoo, CoinDCX, and Onus Finance.

Usually, when an asset obtains listings on new exchanges, its price goes through considerable fluctuations. However, DYP did not experience any notable changes with its recent listings. However, its value surged on June 7 from $0.06 to over $0.20. Furthermore, it has continued to trade above that level for almost two months.

Nearly a week after the price surge, DYP published a blog post explaining its Metaverse project and virtual reality (VR) play-to-earn (P2E) game. In it, players can venture with their CAWS NFTs, increase their levels, or use their DYP / iDYP tokens for game-related purposes.

CAWS is an NFT collection of cats-wearing watches that come with the possibility of staking your NFT. Each asset possesses more than 200 unique attributes, including watch preferences and personalities. For the moment, CAWS owners can use their NFT to play a 2D play-to-earn game with attractive rewards for its champions. Players must own at least one CAWS NFT to participate in DYP's latest GameFi adventure platform. In the near future, the utility of this NFT collection will expand to the Metaverse platform and CAWS will be a companion for the players that own at least one cat in their V.R. adventure.

Story continues

Additionally, DYP is increasing its brand awareness by expanding its actions in the real world. For instance, the project sponsored two racing teams for two different events: Racebox and the Mojo Yachting Club to be more precise.

Daniel Garrett, Marketing and Communications Manager at DeFi Yield Protocol, stated in an AMA on Monday that DYP’s project is unique due to its wide range of products, including its NFT collection and Metaverse game.

Also, he elaborated on the project’s plans to onboard more users and reach mainstream adoption by using its Metaverse-related products and launching its IOS and Android apps.

“In general, as you hear more about DeFi Yield Protocol, as you get more familiar with what we’re doing, I think the users are gonna come,” he said. “We’re focused right now, and this is a great opportunity to get in on something on the ground floor.""

Another significant development was DYP's sponsorship of the Deep Forest Fest. The prestigious event boosted the project's brand awareness and enabled the team to meet some fellow DYPians. Also, it aligned with the project's philosophy - ""Together we can create unforgettable moments. This is what life is all about.""

About DYP

DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) seeks to build a decentralized ecosystem incorporating numerous DeFi products and services, including yield farming, staking, NFTs, and Metaverse gaming. The project runs on unique smart contracts using DYP’s proprietary anti-manipulation functionality.

2022-08-26,A16z-backed CoinSwitch exchange raided over alleged forex law breaches - Cointelegraph,"Major Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber had five of its premises searched by Anti-Money Laundering agents on Thursday over alleged violations of forex laws.

According to a Thursday report from Bloomberg, India’s Enforcement Directorate searched CoinSwitch Kuber’s offices as well as the residences of its directors and CEO Ashish Singhal.

A source told the publication the crypto exchange is under suspicion of acquiring shares worth more than $250 million in contravention of forex laws, as well as being non-compliant with certain Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

The Directorate of Enforcement is a federal enforcement and intelligence agency operating under the Ministry of Finance. According to its website, the agency’s primary objective is the enforcement of acts including the Foreign Exchange Management Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

CoinSwitch Kuber said in a statement: “We receive queries from various government agencies. Our approach has always been that of transparency:”

“Crypto is an early stage industry with a lot of potential and we continuously engage with all stakeholders.”

Launched in India in 2020, CoinSwitch Kuber is one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, alongside WazirX and CoinDCX, with over 18 million registered users.

CoinSwitch Kuber reached unicorn status last year after raising $260 million in a Series C funding round led by Coinbase venture capital arm Coinbase Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. The company is also backed by Sequoia, Paradigm, Ribbit and Tiger Global.

The actions follow a continued clampdown on the cryptocurrency space in India.

Earlier this month, Enforcement Directorate froze roughly $8.1 million in funds from crypto exchange WazirX, alleging that the crypto exchange facilitated transactions by unnamed fintech firms “to purchase crypto assets and then launder them abroad.”

2022-07-29,I crashed Mining Disrupt 2022 - CoinGeek,"Attending the annual Mining Disrupt conference was an interesting journey this week.

Something about the whole hashing industry is a little bit unsettling, because while I think there are actually a lot of well-meaning people in the industry, I’m certain that almost none of them realize that they have only ever been rewarded by a Bitcoin era that has been heavily subsidized. The first subsidy was by the built-in block reward that was meant to bootstrap the Bitcoin economy in the early days, and the other is more macro-economic: the great era of quantitative easing.

Hashing for subsidies has been extremely profitable, and the continual arms race in hashing has led to levels of efficiency that were frankly unfathomable to the Bitcoin economy just a decade ago. But there is ZERO readiness to function in a world with quantitative tightening and a very low emission rate of the Bitcoin block subsidy.

This lack of self-awareness was embodied at the event by the branded Lambos out front that had their decals scraped off the moment they were done being presented to entrants.

Rent me, don’t dent me!

I don’t want to be critical of the event, because in many ways, it was insightful, but there were so many redundant presenters! Essentially, every booth was a mix of ASIC distributors, hosting providers, and pod manufacturers. There were also pools, but only 3-4 showed up to present. Foundry, KuCoin, Braiins/Slush, Luxor and AntPool were there for some variety, but that’s about it!

So in a room with probably 80-90 presenters, nearly every booth was offering the same thing which sort of commoditized the whole experience for me.

However, there were a few standouts.

“The Coin Dad” put together a museum of ASIC mining showcasing every machine that mined bitcoin (that we know of). I spent a serious amount of time reading the notes about these machines, and really enjoyed talking to the other tech history nerds!

Antique ASICS

Braiins OS is a piece of ASIC tuning software that allows very low level management of individual ASIC hashers and the total fleet. For example, if you have 10 S19 Antminers, there will be some variance in their quality. The most capable unit in the fleet should be given the most work to do while the least capable unit in the fleet should be given the least work to do. This is in contrast to work being divided up evenly among all machines regardless of capability.

One of the brains behind Braiins

The software also allows overclocking, under-volting and some other exciting tuning options to optimize for efficiency.

Anecdotally, I remember about five years ago that “covert” ASICboost was a major sticking point among small blockers as a major reason why devs and non-mining nodes should have the ability to add soft forks to stop miners from “cheating.” Today, you’re barely competitive unless you’re using ASICboost, and heavily modifying every aspect of your hardware operation.

Another thing that stood out was the heavy move toward immersion mining and hydro cooling pod systems. Modularity was at an all-time high, and the industry is finally figuring out that liquid is better at heat management than air. Who could have known?!

Luxor Pool was another standout because the guy running their table was a fan of CoinGeek and GorillaPool, so he spotted me and was very friendly. We talked about some of the unique tools that Luxor offers, including their juicy affiliate program, and their very useful hashrate price indexes to let you know when it’s time to buy Bitcoin ASICS based on real data!

Source: Luxor.com

The AntPod hydro pod system was a unique piece of integrated hardware with purpose-built plumbing for liquid cooling that flows through pipes and then right into the hash boards inside the Hydro Antminers. In contrast to the other pods that were little more than well-powered and networked shipping containers, this was an interesting new idea. Operationally, I would be concerned about having so many light duty hoses facing the isle that could accidentally be dislodged by a passerby. But maybe I’m just being paranoid.

Tubing. Much tubing.

I also give kudos to the liberal use of colored LED lights in the pods. If you’re going to light them up, I’m glad they’re lit up in a way that is fun.

Don’t flick the switches!

The last, and maybe the most interesting thing at the whole event was the “Dragonfly” integrated pod.

This is a hashing machine designed by MIT alumni and functioning as an amalgamation of the best aspects of ASICs and immersion pods, but without any of the fluff! Rather than buying individual ASIC units and stacking them into racks in what is essentially a trailer, the hashing unit itself is deconstructed and then reassembled as part of a larger, integrated unit.

width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""> width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"">

The hash boards are lined up, suspended from a hanger rail, and they are dropped as a unit into fluid saving (my guess) 80-90% more space vs lining up Antminers on a rack. Then the hash board tubs are slid into drawers where they connect with power, plumbing for the liquid coolers, and then the cooling apparatus on the side of the machine. The entire unit is about the size of a typical bathroom stall, and it’s capable of 5-9 petahashes per second of power which is a massive cost savings over buying ASIC machines and then general purpose immersion tubs and the other necessary hardware.

Conclusion: hashing is moving ever closer toward pure, raw efficiency, and it’s cool to see the work being done. It’s also good to see that the data management capabilities that are created by the existence of such systems are still going largely unnoticed outside of the BSV economy, so there is a ton of opportunity to innovate in that space with very little competition.

It was awesome to connect with some allies, and meet a few people who whispered, “Hey, we quietly mine BSV too.” I also had a dinner with a handful of people who recently saw the light on the BSV opportunity and want to switch their mining over to the only chain that scales in order to serve a very data-heavy client that they have been working with for years and who is interested in seeing their data on the blockchain.

I bumped into a couple of guys from TAAL at the event too!

It was also good to see Stephen from PrintCrypto, who was a banner sponsor of the event. His company is a host to a significant amount of hash power that sits on GorillaPool for some of our mutual retail clients, and he’s a heck of a cool guy.

When the world sees the stuff that will grow out of some of my more clandestine meetings from Mining Disrupt, people are going to wonder how they missed the boat.

I’ll just have to remind them, “I was at your booth in 2022!”

2022-08-02,Did Shiba Inu Founder Ryoshi Launch Another Token 'Dejitaru ... - Watcher Guru,"The mysterious Shiba Inu founder Ryoshi disappeared in May 2022 by deleting his Twitter handle and Medium blogs. Ryoshi’s whereabouts and his identity remain to be a mystery as the founder chose to be anonymous throughout.

However, speculations are rife that Ryoshi could be someone influential in the crypto space. There are rumors that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin or Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be Ryoshi, but none of it is confirmed. Nonetheless, new speculation is brewing that Shiba Inu founder Ryoshi has launched another token named ‘Dejitaru Tsuka’, reported Express.co.uk.

Why Investors Claim Shiba Inu Founder Ryoshi Launched ‘Dejitaru Tsuka’

Crypto enthusiasts claim that Ryhoshi has returned from his hiatus and might have launched yet another project Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA). The speculation comes after several investors deciphered Dejitaru Tsuka’s cryptic blockchain messages and connected them to Ryoshi.

Many find Ryoshi’s Shiba Inu language and tone similar to that of Dejitaru Tsuka’s language in its first Medium blog. In addition, the first blog has the same picture of a Japanese Yogi which is also the profile picture of Ryoshi’s Twitter handle.

Now coming to the language and tone of the blog, there are similarities, which include spiritual and cryptic metaphors. For example: “We must teach others to be bold, yet humble and be not ashamed to be hunters. Tsuka is our place of refuge. We meditate, we reflect, we research, we engage our minds to plant seeds of faith in ourselves and in humanity.”

Read here to glance through Dejitaru Tsuka’s first Medium blog which was published on July 8, 2022.

Those who have read Shiba Inu’s first Medium blog ‘All Hail the Shiba’ might agree that the tone is similar. However, we can’t read SHIB’s first blog again as Ryoshi deleted it before vanishing on May 30, 2022.

Can Dejitaru Tsuka Founders Be Impersonators of Ryoshi?

The point to be noted in Dejitaru Tsuka’s first blog is that it signs off at the last as “Ryoshi”. Here’s what it says: “We need nothing, we seek nothing, we desire nothing. We are nobody. We are Ryoshi. – ALL HAIL TSUKA.”

Many a time, bad actors always impersonate others to gain leverage or attract attention. Impersonation attacks and spreading disinformation saw a dramatic spike since 2020, including impersonating celebrities, leaders, and politicians, among others. Read here to know more about the outbreak of impersonation attacks that’s taken over social media.

In conclusion, there’s no way to confirm that Shiba Inu founder Ryoshi is behind the launch of the Dejitaru Tsuka token.

2022-07-14,What Is Delegated Proof-of-Stake and How Does It Work? - CoinCodex,"Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm used by several popular blockchains that ensures the integrity and security of transactions. DPoS is a version of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that puts emphasis on community governance through delegation mechanisms.

In this article, we’re going to cover the main differences between the two systems used to reach the consensus about the state of the ledger and describe how DPoS works – but first, let’s take a closer look at the key characteristics of the Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus.

Key highlights:

Delegated Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism used by decentralized blockchain systems

Users can vote on witnesses and delegates to determine who verifies transactions and produces new blocks

Validators that handle the network’s consensus process earn staking rewards and distribute a portion of rewards back to users who delegated their coins to them

DPoS networks are highly scalable and energy-efficient, but also more centralized than PoS and PoW systems

What is Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)?

The Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm features a voting and delegation mechanism designed to incentivize users to stake their digital assets to participate in the process of securing the network and verifying transactions.

DPoS is one of the three most widely used consensus algorithms that are used to facilitate on-chain transactions. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency, uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol. In Proof of Work, cryptocurrency miners utilize vast amounts of computational power to solve resource-intensive mathematical equations. The first one to reach the correct answer is entitled to supply the next block to the blockchain, a task that is rewarded with a block reward.

Proof-of-Stake is the second most popular consensus algorithm, used by major blockchains such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and soon Ethereum (ETH). Instead of relying on cryptocurrency mining and solving of complex mathematical problems, PoS cryptocurrencies are secured with users staking their digital asset holdings in exchange for staking rewards.

In Delegated Proof-of-Stake, only a limited number of users can directly participate in the process of securing the network and issuing of new blocks. While all users are able to stake their coins, they can’t directly participate in the consensus process as validators.

The major benefit of DPoS blockchains, when compared to PoW and PoS chains, is their high scalability and the ability to facilitate a greater number of transactions per second (TPS) due to the faster production of new blocks.

However, putting more power over network operations in the hands of a smaller number of users has drawn a substantial amount of criticism over the high degree of centralization of DPoS networks over the years. In the same vein, groups of users are able to influence the democratic process and determine which nodes are granted the block production rights, which is another disadvantage of the DPoS consensus mechanism.

How does Delegated Proof-of-Stake work?

Delegated Proof-of-Stake blockchains – as the name suggests – require users to delegate the task of validating transactions on the network to elected delegates through community governance. Delegates stake digital assets on behalf of users who staked their coins and share staking rewards among them.

In practice, delegates that run network nodes that are able to verify new blocks are selected based on their reputation via an on-chain election process. For this reason, many argue that DPoS should be considered a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) system.

With a quick explanation of DPoS behind us, let’s examine the key facets of DPoS in more detail.

Voting Process

Voting is the quintessential property of the DPoS algorithm. While there are differences in how different blockchain networks implement the voting system, the underlying structure is the same among all DPoS cryptocurrencies. Users either vote directly on block producers or grant their voting power to users that can vote on their behalf. The nodes that are voted in are called witnesses.

Witnesses

Witnesses are responsible for securing the blockchain network and verifying transactions. They are elected by users who participate in voting with their digital assets. If network participants believe a witness is doing a poor job, or someone could do a better one, they can be replaced. Witnesses are able to confirm transactions and record them in a digital ledger of transactions. Witnesses can’t change the information about blockchain transactions.

Delegates

Delegates can be thought of as user-elected governance supervisors – they make sure that governance processes are legitimate and can propose changes to various network parameters, including the size of blockchain blocks, distribution of staking rewards, and more, that are voted on by the community. The number of delegates typically ranges between 21 and 101, depending on the size of the network.

Block Validators

Block validators are users that ensure witnesses adhere to consensus rules employed by their respective blockchain networks. They validate blocks and make sure transactions are processed correctly. While they earn no financial compensation for their efforts, block validators are an essential part of the network, allowing full nodes to share the same transaction and balance data in a decentralized manner.

Comparing Proof-of-Stake vs Delegated Proof-of-Stake

As briefly mentioned above, DPoS can be thought of as a more scalable, faster, and energy-efficient version of PoS. However, these advantages come with a caveat – DPoS systems are more centralized than their PoS counterparts, not to mention PoW networks.

For a better understanding of the main differences between DPoS and PoS, let’s outline the main advantages and disadvantages of the two consensus mechanisms.

The pros of Delegated Proof-of-Stake: Faster block validation and transaction times than PoS

Users participate in security and governance by staking their assets

Witnesses and validators can be voted out whenever the community deems necessary

More energy efficient than PoS The cons of Delegated Proof-of-Stake: The network’s operation hinges on community participation and educated voters

DPoS networks are more centralized than PoS systems, prone to the formation of so-called Delegate Cartels

The pros of Proof-of-Stake: Requires less community engagement – users need only to stake their coins to participate in the process of validating transactions

Staking rewards are distributed to users directly with no intermediary

While not as energy efficient as DPoS, still vastly more efficient than PoW Low cost and fast transactions The cons of Proof-of-Stake: The share of coins a user has typically translates directly into more power on the network

More centralized than PoW systems

Determining which of the two consensus mechanisms is better is ultimately a fruitless endeavor. Subjectively speaking, some users might prefer Delegated Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies due to the democratization of governance and transaction validation. In turn, some would say that these processes can be exploited and are now worth the price of a higher degree of centralization.

At the moment, a significantly larger number of blockchain networks use PoS when compared to DPoS. Here’s a list of some of the most well-known cryptocurrencies using each consensus, sorted by their respective market caps as of July 2022.

Prominent examples of Delegated Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies include:

Prominent examples of Proof-of-Stake coins include:

Final thoughts

Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus introduces democratic principles to the blockchain sector, allowing the community to participate in decision-making processes that determine who produces new blocks, verifies transactions, how staking rewards are distributed, and so forth. In addition, DPoS systems can facilitate a larger amount of faster and cheaper transactions than similarly sized PoS and PoW networks. However, the improvements in network throughout come at the cost of greater centralization. In addition, the stability and overall performance of DPoS networks rely on users who vote on delegates, witnesses, and proposals, which can be a double-edged sword.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE2NzQ5L3doYXQtaXMtZGVsZWdhdGVkLXByb29mLW9mLXN0YWtlLWFuZC1ob3ctZG9lcy1pdC13b3JrL9IBXWh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE2NzQ5L3doYXQtaXMtZGVsZWdhdGVkLXByb29mLW9mLXN0YWtlLWFuZC1ob3ctZG9lcy1pdC13b3JrLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

KuCoin to Offer Fraction NFT Ownership Via New ETFs

In further ETF-related news, crypto exchange KuCoin has become the first major exchange to offer its users the chance to own a fraction of top Non-fungible Token (NFT) collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) via a new ETF. KuCoin is offering a range of USDT-denominated ETFs in conjunction with Fracton Protocol.

Fractol Protocol is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol that fractionalizes valuable NFT collections into fungible ERC-20 tokens. The new ETFs lower the bar for retail investors to own valuable NFTs, KuCoin said, adding that they also remove the need to manage NFT infrastructure elements, such as wallets and smart contracts.

South American Soccer Team Buys Player in USDC

Sao Paulo, one of the largest football (soccer) teams in Brazil, just bought a player from mid-table Argentinian team Banfield using USDC, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by US-based Circle Internet Financial. The exchange of funds took place on Bitso, one of South America’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Bitso became the sponsor of Sau Paulo football club back in January. The firm’s CEO Thales Araújo de Freitas called the transaction a “historic moment for Bitso, São Paulo and South American soccer more broadly”. The transactions was viewed in Argentina as an attempt by Banfield to bypass the country’s restrictive foreign exchange restrictions.

Under current rules, exports must convert their newly acquired US dollars to Argentinian pesos within five days at a punitive rate of just 131 pesos on the dollar. In informal markets, the exchange rate is closer to 300 pesos per dollar. The forex restrictions, which are imposed by the Central Bank of Argentina, do not reference “crypto”, however.

CoinFLEX Reduces Headcount Amid Cost Reduction Push

Beleaguered crypto exchange CoinFLEX announced on Friday that it has reduced its employee headcount by a significant amount across all departments and geographies, as part of a push to reduce its costs by 50-60%.

CoinFLEX recently halted withdrawals and is currently attempting to recover an $84 million debt owed by a single large individual investor.

“We will monitor costs to ensure we operate as efficiently as possible and scale as volumes come back,” the company’s co-founders Sudhu Arumugam and Mark Lamb said in a blog post. “The intention is to remain right-sized for any entity considering a potential acquisition of or partnership opportunity with CoinFLEX”.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5meGVtcGlyZS5jb20vZm9yZWNhc3RzL2FydGljbGUvNS10aGluZ3MtdG8ta25vdy1pbi1jcnlwdG8tdG9kYXktYnRjLW9uLWNvdXJzZS1mb3ItYmVzdC1tb250aC1zaW5jZS1vY3RvYmVyLTIwMjEtMTA4MTAwM9IBdGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmZ4ZW1waXJlLmNvbS9lbi81LXRoaW5ncy10by1rbm93LWluLWNyeXB0by10b2RheS1idGMtb24tY291cnNlLWZvci1iZXN0LW1vbnRoLXNpbmNlLW9jdG9iZXItMjAyMS8xMDgxMDAz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-09-01,KuCoin Wallet Adds Native Swap Function To Give Users The ... - Business Wire,"VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has successfully launched the native swap function in the service’s flagship product – the KuCoin Wallet. The new feature is designed to provide users with a streamlined and convenient digital asset swap at the lowest fees.

KuCoin is applying the innovative Pathfinder algorithm developed by 1inch in the KuCoin Wallet application to give users access to the lowest rates based on aggregation of over 250 liquidity sources. The launch has become possible after extensive beta testing of KuCoin Wallet, which included over 70,000 registered users and provided valuable feedback about the application’s operability.

The native swap function frees users from having to redirect to third-party services and exchanges, allowing them to conduct all swap operations directly through the KuCoin Wallet. The swap also comes with a high degree of security, provided by the non-custodial nature of the KuCoin Wallet, which hands over all asset custody and access to the users. A platform service fee of 1% will be automatically factored into each operation to boost the development of the KuCoin Wallet and ensure the addition of more functions and amenities in the future.

“We are always striving to make our product cater to the needs of all investors. Swap is a high-frequency feature of the wallet and 1inch is one of the most popular DEXs in the Web-3 industry, so we work together through native integration to provide a smooth and cost-effective trading experience for our users,” as Jeff Haul, the Head of KuCoin Wallet, commented on the launch of the swap function. Haul added that as a gateway to the Web-3 world, KuCoin Wallet is willing to integrate any excellent DApps that can provide high value to users.

2022-10-03,"EXCLUSIVE: KuCoin Open To Cooperating With South Korea To Freeze Bitcoin In Do Kwon Fiasco, Says CEO - Yahoo Finance","Amid reports that the beleaguered founder of Terra blockchain Do Kwon moved 3,313 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) to two cryptocurrency exchanges outside South Korea just after an arrest warrant was issued against him, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu on Monday said the crypto exchange was working to cooperate with the government and regulators “as things go on.”

According to reports, the transferred Bitcoin was worth over $69 million.

Crypto market in a crisis far worse than earlier ones

In an exclusive interview with Benzinga, Lyu also said the ongoing crisis in the crypto market was “a lot worse” than earlier ones and that it will take a major event or rational economic policies to help the ailing markets.

“As a crypto exchange, we are open to cooperating with all prosecutors or regulators around the world but for a specific incident, we would like you to clarify with South Korean officials or regulators. Also, it is not our position to clarify this issue because as a crypto exchange, we are not in a position to figure out this whole thing, and we are just working to cooperate with the government and regulators as things go on,” Lyu said.

Asked to comment if regulations will help drive up the prices of major crypto tokens, the CEO of the Seychelles-based company said the ongoing crisis is going to end differently than the previous ones because earlier, new projects came up in times of crisis that would bring the whole industry back to life.

Only a major event can stabilize market

“But this time we are seeing a lot of different challenges and crises coming up that are a lot worse. As we are witnessing the war between Russia and Ukraine and having market crashes in the traditional finance and crypto markets. We are also seeing a big shuffle of regulatory policies around the world, especially in terms of the crypto industry,” he said.

Overall, the crypto winter is bound to end sometime, but Lyu says he's not sure when. ""It might take a major event or rational economic policies to bring us back to life and stabilize the economy, but we still have to wait and see. We think for this particular crypto winter, the external factors may matter more than internal factors happening inside the industry,"" he added.

ETH Merge will help drive Bitcoin price

Asked to elucidate his stand on the future of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) after The Merge, Lyu said the protocol’s shift to a Proof of Stake mechanism, rather than helping it, will instead help drive up the price of Bitcoin eventually.

“Both have been based on the PoW model and their work ensured fair, open, and decentralized trading of all cryptos. In terms of why ETH exists in the first place is because miners supporting ETH all this time that mattered the most,” he said.

He further added that The Merge will hurt their interests, and they will feel betrayed.

How to transfer Tether (USDT) from KuCoin to OKX?

KuCoin and OKX are two well-known exchanges in the crypto space, with a long track record of providing top-notch digital assets services and products. They`ve done a lot regarding security, then, they are trusted in the space. In this article, we’ve prepared a full-detailed guide about the process of sending Tether (USDT) from Kucoin to OKX.

About KuCoin

Step-by-step guide to transferring crypto between KuCoin and OKX

The method of transferring crypto from Kucoin to OKX is easy and fully accessible even for crypto newcomers. In this guide, we`ll provide a detailed explanation about sending USDT from Kucoin to OKX. While we’ve selected USDT for the purposes of this guide, keep in mind that transferring any other type of supported crypto follows the same process.

1. Log in to your OKX account and get your USDT deposit address

Log in to your account and go to the Assets tab. It is on the right side of the page. Click the Deposit tab and after that, search USDT from the list.

Now, select the chain that you want to transfer USDT on it. The chain must be supported by both OKX and Kucoin exchanges. USDT supports blockchains like ERC20, TRC20, and OMNI, to name a few. TRC20 is cheap and fast, and the favorite among the majority of crypto users. OKX provided a warning for users regarding the correct address and appropriate chain. Users have to read the warning and click I Understand to continue. If you copy the wrong address or choose an inappropriate chain, your money will lose forever.

Then, you have to choose the account in which you want to deposit USDT to it. For instance, if you are going to deposit USDT to your trading account, copy the USDT deposit address on that account. Additionally, you can also scan the QR code.

2. Withdraw USDT from Kucoin to the address you’ve copied from OKX

Go to your Kucoin Main Account and seek Withdraw tab. If you have USDT on other accounts, you have to transfer them to Main Account to be able to withdraw. If you are using the app, first click on the Assets tab, and then, go to withdraw. When you entered the withdrawal page, search for USDT.

Now, you need to insert the copied address from OKX and choose the appropriate chain that is supported by both exchanges. Enter the amount of coin that you want to withdraw as well. You have to input the trading password and complete the security steps. The steps depend on your customized settings.

Finally, click Submit. After that, a message for successful withdrawal will be displayed.

3. Check your USDT on OKX

Go back to your OKX account. The USDT will be there after a couple of minutes, depending on the network’s congestion at the time of transfer.

Further information

People have to transfer coins between exchanges due to a plethora of reasons. Altcoin listings between exchanges are different, and some of the altcoins aren’t available on all platforms. In that case, if you want to trade a certain altcoin, you have to transfer funds to a platform that supports it.

Additionally, users are sometimes enticed to transfer assets to a certain exchange to take advantage of exchange-specific promotions, ranging from deposit bonuses, to trading leaderboards.

What’s more, the minute discrepancies in the price of digital assets between digital asset platforms can create arbitrage, which is especially popular amongst professional crypto traders.

Closing thoughts

The process of sending USDT from Kucoin to OKX is safe as long as you are doing the above-mentioned steps correctly and pay attention to security precautions. For instance, if you copy the wrong deposit address, you never see your money again. If you are a beginner, try with small amounts first, before venturing to bigger transfers. Hopefully, this guide served as a good resource for transferring crypto from KuCoin to OKX.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE5MjM4L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20ta3Vjb2luLXRvLW9reC1hLXN0ZXAtYnktc3RlcC1ndWlkZS_SAWRodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTIzOC9ob3ctdG8tdHJhbnNmZXItdXNkdC1mcm9tLWt1Y29pbi10by1va3gtYS1zdGVwLWJ5LXN0ZXAtZ3VpZGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-27,Is KuCoin Available in the US? - Privacy News Online,"KuCoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and that’s for good reason. Although Bitcoin is down 58% this year and about 72% from its all-time high, it could still be the perfect time to invest while prices are low.

Before you join the ranks of crypto connoisseurs, you need to sign up on a reputable exchange. You can find dozens, if not hundreds, of exchanges online. So, how do you know which is the right one? It’s an important choice with a lot of consequences.

Unfortunately, the US restricts many crypto exchanges, which makes trading a little bit more difficult. Although KuCoin is technically not available for US citizens, it doesn’t mean you can’t trade at all. We have a workaround to let you enjoy crypto safely and anonymously, free from limitations.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital asset backed by blockchain technology. A digital ledger is used to keep all cryptocurrency transactions transparent, making it near-impossible to counterfeit or use loopholes for double-spending.

Cryptocurrency is technically immune to government reinforcement or manipulation, although many major governments are interested in regulating the crypto space. Others, like China, have banned cryptocurrency entirely.

Using crypto, you can invest in thousands of potential projects offering different communities, goals, and the use of blockchain technology. Of course, investing in crypto also comes with the risk of exposing your personal information to fraudsters online.

What Is an “Asset”?

KuCoin has more than just the top 10 cryptocurrencies available for trade.”

Crypto projects create tokens of their own most of the time. For example, metaverse games have tokens used to purchase in-game items. Axie Infinity has the AXS token, and Sandbox uses the SAND token to fund the in-game economy. Investors can join the community and purchase tokens with the hope their prices go up, or just use them as intended.

Bitcoin was the first official cryptocurrency to be released and has remained at the top ever since. Not only that, but it’s still the #1 asset in the crypto industry and has an impressive market cap worth billions of dollars.

KuCoin lists Bitcoin for trade, but it also has hundreds of other tokens to consider, so you’ve got to do your research before committing to any projects.

Why is KuCoin So Popular?

“KuCoin is great, but is traditionally limited for US accounts.”

KuCoin is a reliable cryptocurrency exchange, especially for beginners who haven’t invested in the space before. It has hundreds of crypto assets to choose from and stellar support.

It was founded by several people in 2013 before being officially launched in 2017. Michael Gan, Eric Don, Top Lan, Kent Li, John Lee, Jack Zhu, and Linda Lin all had a part to play in the development of KuCoin. Nowadays, the exchange is owned by two people, but Johnny Lyu, the CEO, is the most public name associated with it.

Crypto exchanges like KuCoin link the internet and your bank when investing in the crypto industry. It used to be hard to purchase Bitcoin, but now it’s quite easy to get your hands on some by simply signing up for a KuCoin account. Not only that, but you can also purchase alternative crypto assets (what the industry calls Altcoins).

However, KuCoin does have one drawback – it’s restricted in the US. Not to the point where you can’t use it, but the US places limitations on how people can trade using KuCoin.

Warning: Cryptocurrency, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), ICO (Initial Coin Offerings), or even NFT (Non-Fungible Token) projects are incredibly volatile and highly speculative. You should consult a certified professional before investing your money or making any financial decisions that involve either of them. This article is for informative purposes only, it does not serve as a replacement for professional recommendations and it’s not financial advice by Private Internet Access or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies (or any of the mentioned projects).

Coinbase vs. KuCoin, Which One Is Safer?

KuCoin claims 1 out of 4 crypto holders worldwide is with KuCoin, which is a testament to its legitimacy. It has 700+ crypto assets available for trade and is considered one of the largest social trading platforms within the crypto community.

Over 20 million investors from all over the world use KuCoin because it’s a proven exchange with the ability to serve 200+ countries. They also remain flexible by providing a mobile app and website.

KuCoin secures accounts through micro-withdrawal wallets (to prevent the theft of large accounts), industry-standard multilayer data encryption, and a mandatory multi-factor authentication system.

“Coinbase is one of the most reputable exchanges on the web right now for many reasons.”

Coinbase, however, has over 100 million verified users in total. It also features 2FA (2-factor authentication) and biometric logins, allowing you to sign in with your fingerprint or face ID.

Coinbase secures accounts with USB drives and paper backups before storing them in vaults/safes located all over the world. If you want to work at Coinbase, you have to pass a criminal background check – but that hasn’t stopped Coinbase employees from committing crimes in the past.

In comparison to KuCoin, the fees on Coinbase aren’t as low and you cannot trade anonymously, so your personal information is slightly more at risk.

Binance vs. KuCoin, Which One Is Better?

As a US citizen, you’re restricted in terms of how much you can deposit or withdraw at once with KuCoin, as well as how much leverage can be used for trades. This is where the argument of Binance being “better” is viable.

Binance.US is easy to use as a US citizen without restrictions. Unfortunately, they offer a limited number of assets and fewer features than KuCoin. Despite this, your data is safe with Binance. They give you the ability to use security features like IP/wallet address whitelisting, device management, biometric logins, and even API access control.

KuCoin has a somewhat complicated process when it comes to USD, especially compared to other exchanges. The number of assets you can trade is hard to pass up on though, so the juice is worth the squeeze!

You can use KuCoin in the US without the traditional restrictions, but you’ll have to adjust a few things beforehand.

Using KuCoin in the US

KuCoin is perfect for getting started in the crypto scene because it’s so easy to use and offers low fees with plenty of coins to purchase. However, it’s restricted for US citizens due to a lack of license and KYC (Know Your Customer) process. As such, you’ll need a bit of assistance if you’re determined to sign up for full membership.

Here are KuCoin’s restrictions for US-based accounts:

1 to 2 BTC limit for withdrawals every 24 hours (which fluctuates according to BTCs price).

for withdrawals every 24 hours (which fluctuates according to BTCs price). No access to leverage or margin trading.

or trading. No KYC verification (to remove limitations).

KYC verification isn’t available for US residents on KuCoin. As such, you can use almost every service on KuCoin in the US, but with limitations – leveraged trading and unlimited withdrawals are unavailable. KuCoin also doesn’t offer the same hack/fraud protection to unverified accounts as they do to verified users.

If the platform sees you’re from a country where these restrictions don’t apply, like the UK, then you’re not subjected to them. You can use Private Internet Access to get a UK IP. PIA hides can give you an IP from whichever location you choose, so you can enjoy KuCoin anywhere.

How to Protect Your Financial Information When You Go Online

We recommend using a VPN when doing anything online – but especially when it regards your financial information. VPNs help you invest in crypto without exposing your personal information, because they hide your online traffic so no one can intercept your trade and steal sensitive information. On top of that, they’re a necessity if you want to trade freely with KuCoin while you travel.

PIA has an independently verified, No Logs policy, which means we don’t monitor or store any of your online activities. We also use 256-bit AES encryption which masks your traffic and protects it from accidental leaks.

Sounds like a much better time, right? To start trading on KuCoin in the US freely, just follow the steps below.

How to Use PIA to Trade on KuCoin When Traveling

Step 1. Sign up for Private Internet Access .

. Step 2. Download the relevant PIA app for your device.

Download the relevant PIA app for your device. Step 3. Open the PIA application.

Open the PIA application. Step 4 . Connect to a location where KuCoin isn’t restricted, like back home.

. Connect to a location where KuCoin isn’t restricted, like back home. Step 5. Sign up for a KuCoin account with PIA enabled.

Sign up for a KuCoin account with PIA enabled. Step 6. Voila! Access the website or app and trade on KuCoin from the US freely.

KuCoin is fully licensed in most European countries, and signing up for an account from these regions gives you access to the full KuCoin experience.

Create the Safest Experience Possible on KuCoin

KuCoin is a worthy exchange for many reasons, but US citizens will find it tough to get signed up at first. You can sign up regularly and have a limited account, but nobody wants that. Since they offer hundreds of assets to invest in and an abundance of advanced trading features, it’d be a shame to miss out on all the action.

Other fully licensed countries allow you to use KuCoin without restrictions or a need for your personal information. A VPN lets you change your IP and make it look as if you’re someplace else.

Get more out of your experience with KuCoin while in the US – all you’ve got to do is sign up for PIA. Private Internet Access protects your personal information, and makes it possible to use KuCoin fully while traveling.

They are a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange that has helped people complete millions of trades over the years. It’s also one of the quickest growing exchanges in 2022. Of course, you’ll need a VPN to use safely while traveling in the US, so you can change your location and avoid any temporary restrictions.

Is KuCoin legal in the US?

Yes, but they lack a proper license. Although KuCoin is currently unlicensed in the US, you can use it with restrictions. The US forces a withdrawal limit of 1 BTC, imposes a restriction on funding options for your trading account, as well as on other activities.

Thankfully, you can trade unrestricted if you use a VPN. PIA hides your IP address, so you can change your location when you travel. We use military-grade encryption to wrap your traffic in code, so no one can read it or see that you’re using KuCoin.

Who owns KuCoin?

KuCoin is owned by “two tech geeks” according to their About Us page. Its most public face is the co-founder and CEO of KuCoin, Johnny Lyu.

Unfortunately, KuCoin lacks a proper license in the US, so you can’t enjoy all the benefits of KuCoin without a bit of help. Sign up for PIA to access KuCoin securely and safely anywhere you are.

Is KuCoin secure?

Yes, KuCoin is secure. KuCoin has completed almost 1 billion trades as an exchange and even has a total trading volume of over 1T USD. Yes, that’s trillion with a T!

However, you’ll still need extra security to stop cybercriminals from stealing your financial information. So, use a VPN to protect your digital identity and trade anonymously.

Is Binance better than KuCoin?

Both cryptocurrencies have their pros and cons. Binance offers low fees and is unrestricted anywhere in the world, but it has a limited number of assets. KuCoin has far more features and assets, but it’s limited for US users. Both use tough security measures to protect your financial data, though, including multi-factor authentication.

2022-10-27,"Toncoin, the native token of the TON blockchain, to be listed on KuCoin | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist","The rise of TON (The Open Network) over the last year has been nothing short of spectacular. Since April, The TON Foundation has announced a host of exciting developments, including high-level negotiations about stablecoin adoption in Cameroon, The Republic of the Congo, and The Democratic Republic of the Congo. Other news has included the creation of large ecosystem funds, such as the Toncoin Fund created in April this year, along with $90m TON Alpha-Vista Fund in July.

More recently, the TON Foundation announced the intention of Telegram to launch a marketplace for tokenised Telegram handles built on TON. A partnership with Huobi Global was also announced in September. This included the listing of Toncoin, the native token of TON, on Huobi Exchange. It now appears that more exchanges are following suit in the wake of this announcement. KuCoin, the world’s fifth largest exchange by volume according to CoinMarketCap, has today announced that Toncoin will be available to trade on its platform from the 27th October.

Toncoin is the native token of TON, a third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain initially designed in 2018 by the Durov brothers, the founders of Telegram Messenger. Later, it was handed over to the open TON Community, which has been supporting and developing it ever since.

TON was designed for lightning-fast transactions and is cheap to use, user-friendly, and fully scalable. The TON Foundation is a non-commercial group of supporters and contributors who help further grow the TON blockchain.

KuCoin’s venture arm, KuCoin Ventures, has worked with the TON ecosystem before, having led the creation of the $250M Toncoin Ecosystem Fund alongside Huobi Incubator. This most recent announcement continues TON’s long-standing collaboration with KuCoin.

Toncoin will be made available to trade in the TON/USDT spot pair. The listing will be marked by a number of activities to promote this significant moment in TON’s story. These activities will include airdrops, competitions, and more. Staking incentives will also be implemented with a generous APR during the limited promotional period.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYml0Y29pbmlzdC5jb20vdG9uY29pbi10aGUtbmF0aXZlLXRva2VuLW9mLXRoZS10b24tYmxvY2tjaGFpbi10by1iZS1saXN0ZWQtb24ta3Vjb2luL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vYml0Y29pbmlzdC5jb20vdG9uY29pbi10aGUtbmF0aXZlLXRva2VuLW9mLXRoZS10b24tYmxvY2tjaGFpbi10by1iZS1saXN0ZWQtb24ta3Vjb2luL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-10-20,"Arcade Raises $3.2M From Crypto.Com, Solana, KuCoin and Other ... - egamers.io","Arcade, a GameFi platform that’s democratising web3 gaming, has raised $3.2 million in seed funding. Several industry heavyweights and renowned investors participated after being swayed by Arcade’s vision of mass market gaming in which anyone can earn monetary rewards.

Led by Crypto.com, the round also included investments from Tenzor Capital, Alpha Crypto Capital, Highland Ventures, Flow Ventures, Panga Ventures, Hindsgaul Capital, WealthUnion, VKS, Khalili Bros, Contango, PlutusVC, and BigBrain all contributed to the seed round. So did PARSIQ, Solana Ventures, Shima Capital, KuCoin Labs, LD Capital, Capital, Rainmaker Games, HotBit, GSR, Moonrock Capital, Non Fungible Labs, W3I, Master Ventures, StarLaunch, Good Games Guild, Prometeus Labs, NxGen, and Merit Circle.

Arcade wants to make blockchain gaming accessible to a global audience and to drive down the financial barriers to participation. These include the requirement to purchase native NFTs, representing land or characters, that can cost hundreds, if not, thousands of dollars. Through its Mission Pools, anyone can earn rewards from engaging in Play-to-Earn activities without the need to own the corresponding in-game NFTs.

KuCoin Labs Head Xinly YU said: “The fundamental difference between a GameFi project and traditional games are the former’s strong finance features. However, not everyone is good at playing or has time to play games and earn. This is where Arcade fills the gap by enabling those groups of people to enjoy earning yields through their specific products without directly playing the games themselves.”

Solana Ventures’ Josh Finer added: “We are excited to support Arcade2Earn as it bridges the gap between DeFi and GameFi on Solana. Whether you are a passive spectator or avid gamer, the Arcade2Earn platform offers unparalleled exposure to the blockchain gaming ecosystem.”

With seed funding in place, Arcade will double down on its mission to transform blockchain gaming and GameFi into a space that is accessible to everyone.

About Arcade

Arcade is built for those who are passionate about GameFi. It connects users with the in-game rewards that are available in any Play-to-Earn game. ‘Arcadians’ can contribute to the community Mission Pool or take on the role of an operator who carries out the skill set required for Play-to-Earn games across multiple chains.

2022-10-11,LUNC fee burning: Will Coinbase and KuCoin heed community calls ... - Capital.com,"Despite being abandoned by its founder and core developers, Terra Classic still has a dedicated community – Photo: Shutterstock

Coinbase is the latest exchange to be pressured by the Terra Classic community to relist the LUNC token and implement its 1.2% burn tax.

In September, LUNC introduced a 1.2% tax on every transaction. These trading fees are then burned to improve the price performance of the failed cryptocurrency.

Both Binance (BNB) and KuCoin (KCS) have reintroduced the terra classic cryptocurrency to their exchanges and implemented this burn tax.

BNB to USD

Coinbase petition

A petition has been filed on Change.org to relist the LUNC cryptocurrency on the Coinbase exchange.

The cryptocurrency exchange delisted Terra Classic earlier this year after it crashed in May.

Despite the development team founding the new LUNA2 crypto and LUNC still finding support from its community, neither are listed on Coinbase.

LUNA2 to USD

According to the Change.org petition:

“Since the rebranding of the Luna coin, after it crashed, the community has been working hard to revive the coin and coming up with strategies to burn the minted coin.”

However, only 423 have signed the petition, at the time of writing.

The petition added: “Since we are hitting new ATH’s every day, we are still missing a vast amount of people which trade on Coinbase and Webull and the community would appreciate it if both re-list LUNC back on for trading.”

Binance and KuCoin integrate burn fee

It is not unheard of for a major exchange to listen to the LUNC community. Binance implemented the 1.2% burn mechanism to all LUNC spot and margin trading pairs in response to the community’s proposal.

Binance keeps track of the amount of burned LUNC every week. For the week from 2 October to 8 October, it saw $916,502 worth of terra classic fees destroyed.

KuCoin is another major exchange to implement the burn tax. It charges 1.2% on every withdrawal of LUNC and terraclassicusd (USTC).

KCS to USD

New listing

Recently, on 10 October, the CetoEX cryptocurrency exchange listed terra classic and integrated its 1.2% burn tax.

However, LUNC’s price has not seen much action since this listing. At the time of writing on 11 October, it was down 4% over the past 24 hours and 7% in the previous week.

Yet, it has managed to sustain its $1.7bn market capitalisation, ranking it 32nd out of all cryptocurrencies, above the new LUNA2 coin.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20vbHVuYS1mZWUtYnVybi1jb2luYmFzZS1rdWNvaW4tYmluYW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-10-20,Kucoin exchange: the platform of the future? - The Cryptonomist,"Kucoin is a Chinese exchange based in Hong Kong. It was established in 2013, but was not operational until 2017, when it launched the facility that exchanges crypto-assets through strategies, such as bonus payment and security.

Kucoin has grown by taking a good share of the crypto market in recent years with due credit, so much so that in 2018 it increased its growth considerably.

The Kucoin exchange was founded by a group of blockchain experts, the CEO of which is Michael Gan. Today, it is led by a team of experts who have international experience with large companies in the blockchain and Bitcoin world such as GFSecurities and ANTFinancial.

Kucoin’s main goal is to offer a secure and intuitive exchange for all audiences with a wide variety of crypto-assets. It also offers one of the most extensive selections of cryptocurrencies.

It handles newly minted cryptocurrencies and because of this very aspect, it stands out as the exchange with the most dynamism and reactive power on market trends. It also recently launched its App for Android and iOS devices.

It currently has a daily volume record of 10,000 BTC, or $150 million, a gigantic amount considering that this exchange is relatively new.

In addition to being on the market with its own cryptocurrency, it offers the classic BTC, ETH and USDT markets and has one of the few NEO markets.

With this in mind, Kucoin could easily be one of the most established, secure, and reliable markets of the future.

The case of Do Kwon on the Kucoin exchange

A curious recent case involving the Kucoin exchange is that of Do Kwon, the South Korean crypto developer and founder of the Terraform Labs project.

The charge brought against Do Kwon, from not so long ago, had him guilty of freezing 56.2 billion won ($39.66 million) belonging to him and stored in two cryptocurrency exchanges, KuCoin and OKX.

However, Terra’s founder promptly denied the news, labeling it a falsehood.

“There is no “cashout” as claimed, I have not used KuCoin or Okex at least in the last year, and no funds from TFL (Terraform Labs), LFG (Luna Foundation Guard), or any other entity have been frozen,”

said Do Kwon.

Meanwhile, Terraform Labs defended Kwon, calling the arrest warrant issued by the South Korean prosecutor against him “unfair.”

The already complicated situation was further aggravated for Do Kwon, as the developer had his South Korean passport confiscated by authorities after the charges against him.

However, Do Kwon stands by his positions and therefore firmly believes that he is not trying to evade the authorities. That said, the crypto entrepreneur is unwilling to reveal where he actually is.

“I’m not using it anyway. I can’t see how this makes a difference,” the Terra founder said in a recent interview, reiterating his denial that millions of dollars in Bitcoin frozen on the OKX and KuCoin exchanges belonged to him or entities he controls.

He also added that he has not used either cryptocurrency exchange for at least a year, as he has no funds in that area. Moreover, Do Kwon argues, he would have noticed without a doubt if the amount charged to him was as large as the reported figures.

Kucoin according to CryptoCompare

CryptoCompare Exchange Benchmark is a market data provider founded in 2014. this market scanner deals with more than 5,000 coins in global markets.

CryptoCompare ranks over 150 centralized to bring transparency and accountability to the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, providing a framework for risk assessment.

Going into even more detail, the platform produces cryptocurrency trade data, order book data, blockchain and historical data, corporate data, reports, and a suite of cryptocurrency indices.

Kucoin also falls within CryptoCompare’s daily analysis.

In particular, analyzing the current data, one can see that over the past six months the volume of USDT within the Kucoin exchange has been decreasing, not worrying yet, but still downward.

In the last month, however, one can observe the peak that occurred around the end of September. Since then, the Kucoin exchange has been steadily decreasing.

The same goes for the past week, a decrease from the peak can be observed, which indicates a smaller amount of money within the exchange.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjIvMTAvMjAva3Vjb2luLWV4Y2hhbmdlY3J5cHRvLXBsYXRmb3JtLWZ1dHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The highly volatile crypto market is home to so many projects that can change the narrative in an investor’s portfolio. However, the most recent crypto crashes have got investors wondering whether they have missed the boat on. While the bearish market subsists, there are still a number of crypto projects one can invest in that guarantee a high return on investment, including Huobi Token (HT), Kucoin (KCS), Chronoly.io (CRNO). The duo of Huobi Token (HT) and Kucoin (KCS) have witnessed massive dips in recent times due to the bearish posture of the crypto market. They are backed by reputable individuals and influencers and offer exciting use cases. Since the market is highly volatile, it is a no-brainer for investors to jump ship in search of projects that can beat the bear market, and that’s why they are purchasing more Chronoly.io (CRNO), even as the latter’s pre-sale has nearly sold out. Chronoly.io (CRNO) is one of theon the Ethereum blockchain. The project hasattracted the attention of the crypto community and the world at large, with its token surging oversince its inception in May 2022. Chronoly.io (CRNO) combines real-world assets with NFT technology. The team members are working assiduously behind the scene to increase its adoption rate and expand its use cases. Ahead, you will learn why Huobi Token (HT) and Kucoin (KCS) holders are purchasing more Chronoly.io (CRNO).The constant crypto crashes have taken a toll on not only Bitcoin but also on smaller projects like Huobi Token (HT). The market downturn has made token holders dump the project for a viable alternative like Chronoly (CRNO). However, the developmental team is working round the clock to reverse the narrative. First, it has partnered with reputable influencers to promote the brand and generate younger leads/investors. Secondly, the team plans to list the native token, HT, on multiple decentralized exchanges. The essence of the listing is to encourage massive adoption by investors from across the world. Additionally, two months ago, the Huobi Token (HT) team moved to reduce the commission for engaging with its products and services. This initiative was meant to attract new users to the exchange. In 2021, Huobi Token experienced an all-time low of $7 from highs of $33. The poor performance didn’t deter the team from granting investors and enthusiasts access to a wide range of derivatives markets for leveraged trading. As of the time of writing this piece, Huobi Token (HT) trades for $ 5.1645945 with a current market cap of $792.03M USD. Huobi Token’s 24-hour trading volume is $38.87M USD.KuCoin (KCS) experienced a boost from new users in the first quarter of 2022, and then the bear market struck the global crypto market. As with Huobi Token (HT), KuCoin (KCS) holders have started jumping ship to join the Chronoly (CRNO) bandwagon. The reason for this may not be unconnected to the massive growth experienced by Chronoly. Despite the move by KuCoin (KCS) holders, the project’s CEO Johnny Lyu has assured the remaining investors still in the network that the bear market is temporary and that KCS token will recover once the market breaks support. In his words “KuCoin is about to embark on a buyback of tokens to cut its coin supply by half. That will increase the value of each token and KuCoin is also set to threaten the other platforms with its daily bonus for holders of over 6 KCS tokens.” At press time, KuCoin (KCS) trades for $8.84 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,630,887 USD.From all indications, Chronoly.io (CRNO) has been morethan the duo of Huobi Token (HT) and Kucoin (KCS) in a bear market. The reason for the success is not far-fetched: Chronoly.io (CRNO) is a project that is. Timepieces or luxury watches have been proven to be a hedge against inflation. Timepieces usually shine during government upheaval and war, and the Chronoly.io (CRNO) team decided to invest in this space. Chronoly.io (CRNO) is an Ethereum-powered marketplace where traders and investors can buy, sell, and trade in rare luxury watches from popular brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, Richard Mille, and Audemars Piguet, for as low as $10. Launched in May 2022, Chronoly.io (CRNO) has grown by over, attracting the attention of both institutional and retail investors from across the world. The Chronoly.io (CRNO) team recently completed and nearly sold out its pre-sale stage 3.

2022-09-27,"South Korea requests KuCoin and OKX freeze Do Kwon's 3,313 ... - Capital.com","Crypto exchange KuCoin, along with OKX, have been asked to freeze the BTC transactions – Photo: Getty Images

South Korea authorities have requested crypto exchanges OKX and KuCoin (KCS) to freeze 3,313 bitcoins (BTC) ($67,000) tied to Do Kwon, the co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs.

Kwon’s company was behind the algorithmic stablecoin terraclassicUSD (USTC) and its sister token terra classic (LUNC), both of which collapsed in value in May 2022.

The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office revealed that the BTC was sent from a wallet linked to Kwon’s Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) to the two crypto exchanges, a day after a Seoul court issued an arrest warrant for Kwon on 15 September, Bloomberg reported.

BTC to USD

This has since been followed by Interpol issuing a ‘red notice’ for Kwon – a formal request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to “locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action”.

According to Interpol, “criminals can flee to another country to try to evade justice. A red notice alerts police worldwide about internationally wanted fugitives.” However, the international police organisation stressed a red notice is not an international arrest warrant.

The collapse of Terraform Labs’ cryptos resulted in $40bn (£37bn) of investor’s money being wiped out, which also fed into the current crypto bear market and a hard fork that led to a new version of terra luna (LUNA).

LUNA to USD

KuCoin willing to co-operate but OKX remains silent

KuCoin has agreed to co-operate with the South Korean courts, but OKX has yet to make a reply, CoinDesk Korea has reported. However, neither of the crypto exchanges are registered in Korea.

‘I’m writing code in my living room’

Kwon broke his Twitter silence on 26 September and had a conversation via the platform with other users. When asked where he is, Kwon replied: “I’m writing code in my living room.”

Kwon had not said anything via Twitter since 17 September.

He added that he is also going on walks and to shopping centres and “making zero effort to hide.”

2022-10-17,Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of October 17 - Investopedia,"Keep An Eye On These Coins

The crypto market has had a fairly low-key October. While the price of Bitcoin dipped briefly below $19,000, it continues to hold around that support level. Some investors believe that the market has bottomed out and that the only way to move is up.

The reduced volatility has some investors thinking that now is the time to enter the market. We examine five cryptocurrencies that have shown price movements and activity over the past week: Huobi Token (HT), Arweave (AR), KuCoin Token (KCS), Hedera (HBAR), and Maker (MKR). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including, but not limited to, positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.

Key Takeaways Huobi Token (HT) experienced a price surge of 60% as a result of news that Justin Sun, a Chinese entrepreneur best-known for his key role in the TRON blockchain project, would serve as an advisor.

Arweave (AR) increased by 15%, thanks to a $30 million funding round for native software development company Community Labs.

KuCoin Token (KCS) announced zero trading fees for Bitcoin and Ether trading pairs, leading to a price increase of 12% for that token.

The Hedera (HBAR) project's market capitalization rose by 7% to $1.4 billion as a result of a partnership and cryptocurrency exchange OKX’s support for HBAR staking.

The market cap of Maker (MKR) expanded by 12% to $980 million following a governance proposal by Gemini digital exchange founder and crypto investor Tyler Winklevoss.



Huobi Token (HT)

The Huobi Token and Huobi exchange have been at the heart of one of the most frequently discussed stories of the past week. The HT token rose by a massive 60% over the past seven days, likely because of the reports of TRON founder Justin Sun allegedly being involved in their acquisition.

While Sun has denied being involved in such an acquisition, he acknowledges he is working as an advisor to Huobi. This helped boost the HT token’s price considerably. The price of HT is now around $6.88, up from around $4.31 last week.



Huobi Token (HT).

Arweave (AR)

Arweave (AR) has jumped by 15% over the past week and is now sitting at around $10. The likely reason for this is the announcement in September of a $30 million funding round for Arweave’s native software development company, Community Labs. The funds will be used for supporting Arweave adoption, ecosystem growth, and protocol development.

Arweave is a project focused on establishing sustainable on-chain data storage. The project has also taken steps forward in terms of its development progress. This includes a testnet release and the launch of a paper on forks and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), among other things. Arweave also has enabled its permanent storage feature on the Polygon network.



Arweave (AR).

KuCoin Token (KCS)

Huobi Token is not the only exchange token to show strong upward movement recently. The KuCoin Token (KCS) is also up by a substantial amount, increasing 12% over the past week.

The KuCoin exchange recently announced that there would be zero trading fees for Bitcoin and Ether trading pairs. This change in policy probably contributed to KuCoin's increase in price. The KCS token is currently trading around $9.80.



Hedera (HBAR)

The Hedera project's market cap recently increased by 7% to $1.49 billion, with the HBAR coin currently priced at around 6 cents.

There could be a few reasons for the project's increase in market cap. OKX announced that it was supporting HBAR staking, while the project also announced a partnership with fund management giant Abrdn. Coinbase also said that it would re-enable withdrawals and deposits for HBAR.



Maker (MKR)

The market cap of the MKR token has shot up by 12% to more than $1 billion. The token is currently priced at around $1,070. It’s a little harder to pinpoint the reason behind this increase, but a new governance proposal might be the impetus.

The proposal was created by Gemini exchange Co-Founder Tyler Winklevoss. It basically asked for the Gemini dollar (GUSD), that exchange's stablecoin, to run on the protocol’s ecosystem. A portion equal to 1.25% of the exchange’s GUSD would be contributed to the protocol. The market cap for MKR was $878.3 million last week, while the current market cap has exceeded $1 billion.

2022-09-08,"Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) Soars 100% Weekly as KuCoin, Gate Io Extend Tax Burn Support - CryptoPotato","Despite the dramatic sell-off of Terra ecosystem tokens, LUNC has managed to rally along with the crypto market favoring the upside.

While the plan continues to revive the chain and attract investors back, the latest surge of more than 100% over the past week after its tax burn confirmation.

At the time of writing, LUNC was trading at $0.00056, recording a daily rise of almost 55%.

As per the new 1.2% Tax Parameter Change proposal, taxes will be charged and burned for on-chain activities, including transfers of LUNC and USTC between wallets and smart contracts.

The proposal essentially seeks to carry out a 1.2% token burn tax on all transactions in a bid to transform LUNC into a deflationary asset.

If passed by Terraform Labs (TFL), the 1.2% tax burn will be activated by September 20.

On the other hand, if the proposal fails to see the light of the day, the new dev team of the ecosystem – Terra Rebels – will offer an unofficial website, desktop app, and mobile app to facilitate tax burns.

KuCoin, in the latest announcement, stated that its services related to LUNC and USTC will remain unaffected if the community chooses not to approve the proposal.

The Seychelles-based crypto exchange has suggested users to deposit all Terra Classic tokens to avoid increased deposit fee costs.

“KuCoin will support the 1.2% tax burn when the proposal is officially approved and implemented on Terra Classic (LUNC) mainnet. Services on KuCoin will remain unchanged if the community does not approve the proposal.”

There is no shortage of hype surrounding the upcoming network upgrade of Ethereum (ETH), with parties popping up that are dedicated to watching the event unfold and the launch of a Google (GOOG) countdown to mark the occasion.

But Johnny Lyu, founder and chief executive officer of the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin (KSC), has told Capital.com that The Merge’s value for the industry is “difficult to overestimate”.

Lyu also warned that “not everything may go smoothly” as he referenced the unexpected technical issues that have accompanied Ethereum’s network updates in the past.

Ethereum ‘can expect a surge in popularity’

With The Merge’s final step just around the corner, Lyu foresees decentralised finance (DeFi) developers flocking to Ethereum as a result of the update’s anticipated improvements.

“The final stage of The Merge is expected to finally solve the problem of scaling and transaction speed. As a result, we can expect a surge in the popularity of Ethereum among DeFi application creators, who have recently massively favoured competing networks, such as Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT) or Polygon (MATIC),” Lyu predicted.

“It is also difficult to overestimate the value of the update for the development of the entire blockchain industry in general and technologies such as Web3 in particular. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 may bring new opportunities for the creation of new applications for which the speed of transactions is important.”

KCS to US dollar

But KuCoin’s CEO also warned of potential technical issues. “The Ethereum network updates have repeatedly been accompanied by unexpected technical problems, and this time not everything may go smoothly,” he said.

Ethereum blockchain’s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) operation to a less energy-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) system can be traced back to 1 December 2020 with the launch of Beacon Chain, but it has been hit with several delays on the way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20va3Vjb2luLWx5dS10aGUtbWVyZ2UtZXRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-10-03,MEXC Leveraged ETF Leads the Cryptocurrency Market as Its Liquidity Ranks First in the World | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist,"Crypto asset trades emerge one after another, and leveraged ETFs are becoming the next star product after futures. MEXC, the cryptocurrency exchange with the highest futures trading liquidity on the Internet, takes the lead again in the cryptocurrency market with leveraged ETFs.

Comparing the leveraged ETF depth indicators of trading platforms such as Binance, MEXC, Kucoin, Gate, and Huobi, and analyzing their leveraged ETF transactions of mainstream cryptocurrencies with the highest market cap, it is found that the top three platforms in depth performance are MEXC, Binance, and Kucoin. The data shows that in terms of the trading depth of BTC 3L, ETH 3L, LTC 3L, and EOS 3L, MEXC ranks first in the aspect of liquidity.

Taking BTC 3L as an example, the depth of 1% on MEXC is 14,403,439USDT; The depth of 1% on Binance, which ranks second, is 87,359.56USDT; And the depth of 1% on Kucoin, which ranks third, is only 48,479.6USDT. At this depth, MEXC has surpassed the sum of Binance and Kucoin, and the gap tends to widen.

MEXC

Comparing ETH, LTC, EOS and other mainstream cryptocurrencies, it can also be seen that MEXC’s leveraged ETF trading has the best liquidity, and the depth of other trading platforms is much lower than MEXC. Meanwhile, according to cryptorank data, Binance’s 24-hour leveraged ETF trading volume was $23.67 million USD, accounting for 63.5% of the market; MEXC’s 24-hour leveraged ETF trading volume was $9.25 million USD, with a market share of 24.8%, ranking second.

MEXC/Cryptorank

The leveraged ETF was first launched by MEXC in November 2019. It is a perpetual leveraged product that magnifies the price change of the benchmarked asset, aiming to provide leveraged returns on the benchmarked perpetual futures. It can be understood as an exchange-traded fund with leverage multiples.

The trading rules of leveraged ETF products are as simple as those of spot products. It is not necessary to use part of the margin to occupy positions like futures. At the same time, it can achieve multiple gains and returns like futures, so it is favored by some investors with low risk appetite.

At present, each token on MEXC supports leveraged ETF trading of 3x long (3L) and 3x short (3S), and some mainstream cryptocurrencies also support 2x, 4x, or 5x leverage and the risk is controllable. For example, when you want to go 3x long for BTC, you only need to buy BTC3L/USDT; When you want to go 3x short for BTC, you only need to buy BTC3S/USDT; And when you want to clear the position, you only need to sell the corresponding position. Leveraged ETFs do not use margins to occupy positions and do not have liquidation rules, so there is no need to worry about the risk of liquidation.

Leveraged ETFs have a rebalance mechanism, and the compound interest effect is obvious. In the continuous rising/falling market, the daily profit will be automatically transferred to the position and reinvested to realize compound interest, and the profit will be higher than that of margin or futures products of the same multiple. At present, MEXC supports leveraged ETF trading of more than 300 cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, DOT, ATOM, SHIB, DOGE, AAVE, CRV, etc. It provides the most cryptocurrencies on the Internet, allowing traders to have different choices in different trends or unilateral market conditions.

2022-09-09,"Despite OSC ban, this crypto exchange still operates as if nothing ... - The Globe and Mail","In June, the Ontario Securities Commission put out a press release trumpeting that the “OSC holds global crypto asset trading platforms accountable.” But that’s not really the case.

One of the two items announced was the regulator’s success in its bid to ban and fine the errant overseas cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin. Yet neither seems to have been enforced, and probably can’t ever be.

This hollow victory of the OSC highlights the difficulties of policing the relatively borderless realm of crypto. And it raises an important question for investors: Despite the OSC ban, should you still use exchanges like KuCoin just because you can?

In 2021, after the $200-million implosion of Vancouver-founded QuadrigaCX’s platform, the OSC had started enforcing tougher rules for exchanges, requiring them to register.

KuCoin, operated by two companies registered in Seychelles and Singapore, failed to do so, leading the OSC to bring a case against it before the regulator’s independent quasi-judicial Capital Markets Tribunal. KuCoin did not respond to that case, so in June, Kucoin was fined $2-million and banned from operating in Ontario.

Yet again, KuCoin did not respond. After the decision against it by the Ontario tribunal, KuCoin outright told users in the province they could continue to use the platform.

“As for the access restriction, nothing is confirmed,” a representative posted on KuCoin’s group on the website Reddit on July 5, more than two weeks after the OSC had ruled against it. KuCoin is still freely accessible in Ontario.

Ontario Securities Commission says it’s looking into cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga

How the crypto crash exposed the sector’s lies – and left retail investors in the lurch

The OSC declined to comment. KuCoin did not respond to a request for comment.

Adam Chisholm, a partner at McMillan LLP and one of the firm’s crypto experts, said KuCoin has likely gotten its own legal advice on the impact of the OSC sanctions.

“That is typically why a foreign company will not bother with Ontario (or Canadian proceedings),” Mr. Chisholm said. “It will usually have some comfort in that an order made here will not be enforceable against it where it matters to them.”

Mr. Chisholm said OSC sanctions could have secondary impacts on KuCoin, affecting whether banks would want to work with it or any plans at doing a public offering. “It could also raise regulatory attention against them in other jurisdictions, as regulators generally want entities to be compliant wherever they operate,” Mr. Chisholm said.

If that is happening, though, those regulators aren’t saying. The financial regulators in Seychelles and Singapore did not respond to a request for comment.

Binance, a Cayman Islands-registered exchange that has had run-ins with the OSC, has long done only crypto-to-crypto trades and in the early days had reportedly operated with no bank account. KuCoin likely thinks that it will be just fine being so brazen.

For investors, this situation with KuCoin may bring to mind Binance’s issues with the OSC, which are quite similar.

Binance, though, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, has taken a different tack from KuCoin. After its run-ins with the OSC, it gave an undertaking to bar Ontarians until it became properly registered. But the Binance exchange can still be accessed by anyone in Ontario with a VPN (virtual private network), a relatively simple tool.

So should you continue to use Binance or KuCoin? The enactment of these bans, after all, are between the OSC and the exchanges, not the users.

Mr. Chisolm said that platforms not operating with the permission of the OSC might not have the necessary safeguards for investors that the regulator requires.

In the case of using a VPN, people doing that violate the platforms’ terms of service and could face problems with withdrawal of assets, Mr. Chisolm said. “Those individuals certainly won’t be able to complain to Ontario regulators if faced with these issues and will have to resolve those problems on their own.”

If you have already used such platforms, though, there might be some good news.

In June, Binance was hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing the platform of illegally offering certain complex trades – that is, without complying with the rules of regulators like the OSC.

Whether you gained or lost money, if you had made certain trades on Binance since Sept. 13, 2019, you’re automatically included as a plaintiff in most cases.

More often than not, such lawsuits never go to trial and end with a settlement for the plaintiffs.

2022-09-29,Demand Rising for Radix’s Native Token XRD as More Top-Tier Exchanges Announce Trading Pairs - Yahoo Finance,"Jersey, Channel Islands --News Direct-- Radix

Radix, a smart contract platform for asset-oriented DeFi, has announced that its native cryptocurrency token XRD is now listed on major exchanges including Bitmart, WhiteBIT, and LBANK with KuCoin and HitBTC coming soon.

The XRD token is available to trade, with key token pairs including XRD/BTC and XRD/USDT already up and running. The listings mark yet another big milestone for Radix, a project that’s pursuing a radically different approach to DeFi to power the next generation of decentralized applications.

The Radix Network has enjoyed stellar growth over the past year. Although it launched in the middle of one of the harshest crypto winters to date, Radix has seen more than 7X growth in transaction volume on its network, while the number of active wallets with at least 2,000 XRD has grown by 52%. Added to that, there are now more than 81,300 active wallets up and running on the network, up from just 11,600 at the start of the year.

Radix is a full-stack solution for DeFi. It includes Radix Engine, the world’s first programmable “DeFi Engine” with native asset features; and Scrypto, an asset-oriented programming language based on Rust, which promises a greatly enhanced developer experience.

The listing of XRD on multiple top-tier crypto exchanges comes in the wake of Babylon Alphanet, the latest major milestone on the journey to Babylon Mainnet, which is when smart contracts written in Scrypto will be live and in production.

Babylon Alphanet is stage two of a staggered release schedule that’s designed to get developers working with new Babylon DeFi capabilities, and test the smooth rollout of multiple interrelated technologies, protocols, and interfaces before they move onto mainnet. The approach ensures those who are building on Radix will have time to migrate smoothly, while providing the rapidly growing community of Scrypto developers with the time they need to plan and test their own decentralized application launches and help bootstrap the wider Radix DeFi ecosystem when Babylon launches.

Story continues

Radix’s impressive growth numbers highlight the excitement that DeFi developers and savvy crypto participants have in its network, future potential, and anticipated ability to scale DeFi to a global level. Now that the Babylon Alphanet is up and running, the newly listed exchange partners are expecting dramatic growth in demand for XRD as Radix conquers another major milestone on the road to Babylon mainnet.

“I’m thrilled to see how the project is accelerating, but I can’t say that I’m surprised”, said Andy Jarrett, CEO of Radix Tokens Jersey, Limited. “We spent the last 8 years building and refining a complete DeFi stack to support a $400 trillion economy, so it’s rewarding to see so many in the crypto community experience the Radix Revelation and join the movement.”

About Radix

Radix is an asset-oriented smart contract platform, purpose-built to support a $400 trillion network. Radix offers a full-stack for Decentralized Finance, without breaking atomic composability. If you know what that means, you know it’s a big deal.

Backed by 8 years of research, testing, and focused development, Radix has a global community of thousands and a network value over $500 million. To learn more, visit www.radixdlt.com.

2022-08-30,"Regulatory Criticism, Internet Troubles Disrupt Spain's Largest ... - Blockworks","key takeaways Speakers included representatives from FTX, KuCoin, Waves and a delegation from El Salvador

A Spanish regulator issued a warning to Mundo Crypto and its sponsors a few days before the event, reminding them they are “not licensed to advise on financial instruments or broker investment transactions.”

Spain’s largest-ever crypto event was met with a few obstacles last week, including not-so-favorable press from a regulator and internet issues that thwarted a Guinness World Record attempt.

Blockchain education platform Mundo Crypto, the event host, intended to deliver a live virtual reality (VR) presentation about its upcoming learn-to-earn metaverse, which aims to transfer its 2D online courses to 3D metaverse offerings.

Almost 7,000 virtual reality headsets were distributed to attendees — a stab at breaking the record for the most people simultaneously using VR displays — but internet connection issues disrupted the company’s plans.

Founder Mani Thawani instead took the stage in person at the indoor sporting arena in Madrid, Spain, instead of his avatar speaking to the audience through the headsets.

“Cryptocurrencies represent freedom. And we know that the expression of freedom converges in the metaverse,” Thawani said, explaining his vision for “responsible massive adoption.” He intends for the Mundo Crypto metaverse to be an educational and virtual “gateway to an industry unknown to many.”

Leading up to Thawani’s presentation, attendees listened to panels featuring companies such as FTX, KuCoin and Waves; European economists; crypto influencers including Brock Pierce; and even a delegation from El Salvador. The spectacle-like event also included a car giveaway, a magic show and crypto jeopardy interludes.

What does it take to put on such a grand-scale event during a bear market? In this case, 2 million euros and regulatory intervention.

A few days before the event, Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) issued a warning to Mundo Crypto and its sponsors, reminding them they are “not licensed to advise on financial instruments or broker investment transactions.”

Mundo Crypto has held a spot on the CNMV’s “gray list” since July 2021, which includes entities not registered with the regulatory body “that could be carrying out any type of fundraising activity or providing any financial service.”

Thawani told Blockworks the resulting media attention had both positive and negative effects. “Thanks to all the news published, we have managed to make the crypto industry more known and to start generating more curiosity. The negative is that many speakers and sponsors dropped due to media and political pressure” he said.

Binance and PlayStation pulled out as sponsors at the last minute. Police and paramedics were parked outside of the WiZink Center for the nearly 7-hour “Metaverse Day.”

Despite the controversy, some attendees found the event — tailored to consumers just starting out in crypto — refreshing.

As opposed to crypto events such as ETHBCN or Solana Breakpoint, which center developers, the Mundo Crypto event “focused on a novice user who is researching about cryptocurrencies, who has friends who have talked about it, or who follows some influencer,” Xavier Molina, FTX’s manager for the Iberia region, told Blockworks.

“I think they wanted to give a show and they did it,” he said. “It was the biggest cryptocurrency show that has been put on in Spain. Most of the criticism came from the crypto community itself, mostly veteran people. But they must understand that it had a different target audience.”

Sasha Ivanov, CEO and founder of Waves protocol, offered some advice to blockchain beginners attending the event: “Stop trading so much. Instead, pick up a project you like and understand how it works. Participate in the community.”

“Blockchain technology needs to be used everyday, not just for trading. The next step is to make blockchains ubiquitous,” he added.

The Mundo Crypto team decided post-event to refund buyers the cost of their ticket — 49.35 euros — whether they attended the event or not.

2022-08-30,China invades India through crypto route - Fortune India,"The Indian government that shut down TikTok at the snap of the finger appears undecided on crypto exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, WazirX, Kraken, Huobi, etc. operating within India. Most of these crypto exchanges are either of Chinese origin or are led by persons of Chinese origin. The government took action against TikTok, a video sharing app, for violating privacy norms. At the same time, bank accounts, Aadhar, PAN , and other sensitive financial details of the Indian public are being collected by these apps whose origin is directly or indirectly linked to China and which are now operating from tax havens.

Moreover, many Indian crypto exchanges also have funding from foreign crypto exchanges. WazirX is an example of an Indian-origin crypto-exchange, allegedly acquired by Binance.

BitMex, a crypto-exchange whose founders have recently pleaded guilty of violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws, is one of the investors of Indian Crypto-exchange, CoinDCX.

Moreover, there are purely foreign crypto exchanges like KuCoin, Binance, Kraken, Huobi etc. operating in India. Indians can buy cryptocurrencies through these exchanges.

2022-09-28,Avalanche Rush Phase 3 begins as KyberSwap celebrates partnership with Avalanche - Cointelegraph,"Singapore, Sept. 26 — One year ago, KyberSwap began a fruitful partnership with Avalanche, starting with a $5.8-million liquidity mining campaign as part of its Avalanche Rush program. Since then, this partnership has helped bring over $61 million in total value locked and more than $10 billion in total trading volume for KyberSwap.

Now, KyberSwap is continuing to provide Avalanche (AVAX) bulls with more incentives for liquidity providers who deposit and stake their liquidity positions on its newest protocol, KyberSwap Elastic.

Commencing on Sept. 26, KyberSwap is hosting Phase 3 of Avalanche Rush, with 17 farms bringing Avalanche liquidity providers up to $2 million in reward incentives. The first stage of Phase 3 is set to bring liquidity providers over $250,000 in KNC and AVAX liquidity mining rewards, with more incentives planned to come over the next phases.

Why add liquidity on KyberSwap Elastic

KyberSwap’s newest protocol, Elastic, is a tick-based automated market maker that gives liquidity providers (LPs) the advantages of concentrated liquidity and the flexibility to achieve capital efficiency and manage risks.

With concentrated liquidity, LPs have the flexibility to supply liquidity to an Elastic pool either by “concentrating” the liquidity to a narrow price range or set to a wider price range. Concentrated liquidity would use the pool’s liquidity more efficiently, mimicking much higher levels of liquidity and achieving better slippage, volume and earnings for LPs, while a wider range would ensure liquidity for uncorrelated token pairs, such as USDC-ETH, and would remain active even with big price swings during high market volatility.

KyberSwap Elastic also has a Reinvestment Curve, which compounds fees by automatically reinvesting the fee earnings of LPs back into the liquidity pool so LPs earn higher annual percentage yields while saving time.

LPs on KyberSwap Elastic can also choose from multiple fee tiers to select the best-suited rates for individuals taking into consideration factors, such as token volatility, individual risk appetites, etc. In addition, KyberSwap Elastic comes with a just-in-time attack protection feature, which protects LP earnings from snipe attacks that would reduce the earnings of other honest liquidity providers. So, LPs can earn securely while enjoying peace of mind.

2022-10-25,Bybit Launches Custodial Web3 Wallet As a Gateway for ... - NFT News and Insights from the Industry - NFTgators,"Quick take:

Bybit’s Web3 wallet is targeted at crypto novices.

The wallet offers cross-chain compatibility, private key management, access to DeFi and NFT marketplace, amongst other features.

Bybit is the third largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange.

Bybit today introduced its custodial wallet to make it more convenient for crypto novices to enter the Web3 space.

The Web3 wallet holds the users’ assets in custody and manages the private keys so that users don’t have to store and manage them on their own. Without the individual responsibility of managing private keys, Bybit claims the wallet makes it more convenient for newcomers to explore the world of Web3.

With the Bybit wallet, users can seamlessly access the decentralized web of DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs. The Bybit wallet also offers benefits such as cross-chain compatibility, airdrop management, access to NFT marketplace and DeFi products, and decentralised identity management.

In December, Bybit Wallet plans to launch the Swap feature in November, IDO and the airdrop management feature that helps users automatically collect tokens on the blockchain.

Bybit is currently the third largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange according to CoinMarketCap. The crypto exchange joins KuCoin in launching a Web3 wallet this year, although Kucoin’s decentralised wallet is self-custodial, which means users have full control of their assets as they manage their own private keys.

Custodial wallets managed by crypto exchanges are widely considered to be less secure than self-custodial wallets as users do not have full control over their private keys and risk losing their assets. However, it is a convenient gateway for non-crypto natives to jump on board the Web3 space due to ease of use and management.

According to blockchain data platform Chainalysis, October is the “biggest month in the biggest year ever for hacking activity” as “$718 million has been stolen from DeFi protocols across 11 different hacks.”

Self-custodial wallets including Omni and Zerion have each successfully raised over $10 million in funds this year as they recognise that users are flocking towards self-custody solutions to manage their digital assets.

2022-10-12,Coinsquare becomes first Canadian crypto exchange to receive IIROC registration - Cointelegraph,"Coinsquare, Canada's longest-operating crypto asset trading platform, announced on Oct. 12 that the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) had approved its dealer registration and IIROC membership. This regulatory status will now position Coinsquare as the first crypto-only IIROC-registered investment dealer and marketplace member in Canada. The Coinsquare team wrote:

""In dealing with an IIROC registrant, Coinsquare clients now have the added comfort and security of knowing that Coinsquare is operating at the highest level of dealer compliance and oversight under the existing regulatory system.""

With the regulation, Coinsquare's client funds will be fully segregated and kept by licensed and insured custodians. Coinsquare will also be required to report its financial standing regularly and maintain adequate capital for liabilities. In addition, cash held in client accounts will be protected by the Canadian Investment Protection Fund in the event of insolvency.

Currently, Coinsquare has more than 500,000 users and offers access to over 40 cryptocurrencies, including more than 820 coin-to-coin trading pairs. The exchange has facilitated approximately $5.82 billion in trades since its inception in 2014.

Canada has taken a different regulatory approach than the United States. In Canada, all crypto exchanges operating in the country must be registered or at least apply to the IIROC.

Step-by-step guide to transferring crypto between PrimeXBT and OKX

The process of USDT transfer between PrimeXBT exchanges is straightforward and accessible even to less experienced crypto users. If this is your first time sending crypto between exchanges, you can opt to transfer a smaller amount for starters; just to make sure that everything is working properly. Now, let's talk about the method of sending USDT from PrimeXBT to OKX.

1. Log in to your OKX account and copy the USDT deposit address

Sign in to your account and select Assets on the homepage. Then, click Deposit and choose USDT from the list.

Now, choose the deposit chain for USDT. USDT supports several chains, including ERC20, TRC20, and ALGO, to name a few. The selected blockchain must be supported by both PrimeXBT and OKX exchanges. Then, there's a warning regarding the deposit that you have to read and tick I Understand. Finally, copy the deposit address or scan the QR code.

2. Withdraw USDT from PrimeXBT to the address you’ve copied from OKX

To withdraw USDT from your account, log in to your account and navigate to the main page. Click Withdraw for the preferred asset (in the case of our example, USDT). Don't forget that the withdrawal features are accessible through the Dashboard.

After that, a pop-up will be available, and you have to choose your USDT withdrawal address or add a new address. Add the address you've copied from OKX. Then, select the amount and click Submit. You have to confirm the withdrawal via your email as well. When you paste your deposit address, be cautious and double-check that. Pasting the wrong address can lead to a permanent loss of funds.

It is worth noting that PrimeXBT has limited coins in its hot wallets due to security precautions, which can lead to a slight delay in transactions.

3. The withdrawn USDT should be available in your OKX account

Now, go back to OKX. The withdrawn USDT should be available in your account momentarily. Keep in mid that a transfer fee has been deducted from the transaction total. To save on gas fees, use TRC20 as the chain to transfer your funds. In some cases, the fees can be as much as 20 times lower when using TRC20 than when using ERC20 USDT.

Additional information about moving crypto from PrimeXBT to OKX

The process of transferring crypto coins between exchanges is not complicated. In fact, the procedure is completely straightforward, fast, and secure. Crypto exchanges support different lists of products and services. For this reason, when you want to take advantage of an opportunity that is available on a certain exchange, you have to transfer your assets to that platform. Some altcoin projects are available on certain exchanges, and if a user wants to buy that altcoin, they have to transfer money to that exchange.

PrimeXBT and OKX are both reputable names in the crypto space, with both companies employing extensive security measures to keep their users’ funds as safe as possible. While both platforms strive to provide a safe platform for users, they cannot ensure that the address you’re transferring crypto to is the correct one. To reiterate, double-check your blockchain address when transferring digital assets and make sure that the network you are sending it through is supported by both PrimeXBT and OKX.

Closing thoughts

The process of sending USDT from PrimeXBT to OKX is safe as long as you are doing the above-mentioned steps correctly and pay attention to security precautions. For instance, if you copy the wrong deposit address, you never see your money again. If you are a beginner, try with small amounts first, before venturing to bigger transfers. Hopefully, this guide served as a good resource for transferring crypto from PrimeXBT to OKX.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE5MzM2L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20tcHJpbWV4YnQtdG8tb2t4LWEtc3RlcC1ieS1zdGVwLWd1aWRlL9IBZmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE5MzM2L2hvdy10by10cmFuc2Zlci11c2R0LWZyb20tcHJpbWV4YnQtdG8tb2t4LWEtc3RlcC1ieS1zdGVwLWd1aWRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-19,Top 5 Coins that Pay Crypto Dividends - Cryptonews,"Top 5 Coins that Pay Crypto Dividends

In the traditional sense, a dividend is a distribution of profits from a company's stock or debt to its shareholders. Now, you may wonder, can cryptocurrencies then pay dividends? Surprisingly, the same concept also exists in the global crypto asset markets.

Read on to learn more about crypto dividends and discover a list of top cryptocurrencies that pay dividends.

What Are Crypto Dividends?

Crypto dividends are a form of profit sharing that is paid to investors as part of a cryptocurrency project’s revenue or fees. In most cases, crypto dividends are offered as an incentive for supporting a project's development and growth by holding onto the project’s native currency.

In traditional finance, dividends are paid out to shareholders based on the number of shares owned by them in a company. The same goes for the cryptocurrency industry. Token holders earn rewards - akin to dividends - in relation to the number of tokens they hold.

Dividend-paying cryptocurrencies typically pay out automatically, so investors aren’t required to perform a specific action. This is usually the case for exchange tokens that pay token holders a share of revenues or trading fees. Conversely, some cryptocurrencies that pay rewards require you to hold your tokens in a specific wallet to receive the rewards.

Top Cryptocurrencies That Pay Dividends

Now let’s take a look at five popular dividend-paying coins you could invest in today.

AscendEX (ASD)

AscendEX, previously known as BitMax, is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore. The ecosystem is fueled by the ASD token, which is an ERC-20 token. By holding ASD, investors can earn dividends in the form of automatic airdrops. The platform has a tiered reward system that allows users to earn more rewards by holding more ASD tokens.

AscendX pays dividends by using a staking system that lets users earn up to 50% of the network's total profits. In other words, if your investment grows by 10%, you'll get paid out 50% of that growth. The other half goes back into the network, which means that if your investment shrinks by 10%, you'll still get half of what used to be there! The dividend payment is calculated using the following formula: (Total Bid Volume/Accumulated Volume) x 50% + 0.1%.

Furthermore, users can purchase AscendEX's ASD Investment Multiple Card, which can be used to earn even more rewards.

Bibox (BIX)

Bibox is a digital asset exchange that was launched in 2017 in China. It offers a wide range of trading options and features, including trade, storage, and wallet services.

Bibox has its native token called BIX, which is an ERC20 token. You can buy and sell BIX in Bibox’s online exchange or through the exchange’s mobile app. The main goal of the project is to provide users with an easy way to buy and sell crypto assets from within the app. In addition, it allows users to enjoy low transaction fees and fast withdrawals.

To earn dividends (staking rewards) in Bibox, you need to lock 500 BIX tokens in your account and trade at least once per week. By completing these tasks, you will receive a percentage of all trading fees generated by your account as a reward, with an APR of around 8%.

KuCoin (KCS)

KuCoin is a popular cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong that was launched in September 2017. In addition to this deep liquidity, the exchange has also been praised for its fast transaction speeds, user-friendly interface, and easy-to-use platform.

KuCoin offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs for its users. It also pays daily dividends to its holders in its native Kucoin Token (KCS) . The daily dividends are issued from 50% of all the fees collected from users on KuCoin.

The KuCoin token (KCS) is an ERC20 token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. KCS holders earn dividends by staking their tokens on the platform. The daily rewards amount to an average of 5.59% annual returns. The more tokens you hold on KuCoin, the higher percentage of your earnings will be returned as staking rewards. This is a unique feature that sets KuCoin apart from many other exchanges.

In addition, it also offers users the chance to vote on new listings and promotions through their KCS holdings. The more tokens you hold, the more voting power you have.

NEO (NEO)

Previously known as AntShares, NEO is a blockchain platform that allows you to issue your digital assets or ""smart contracts"", and trade them on the NEO platform. The platform also offers a set of developer tools that allow users to build their smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). As a result, it is also called the ""Chinese Ethereum.""

The NEO ecosystem is powered by GAS, which is an internal currency that can be used to pay for transaction fees and also reward staking/holding tokens in wallets over time (dividends). GAS is distributed according to how long you hold your NEO tokens; you get more if you hold them for longer periods. As it stands, you receive 0.0003 GAS per day for every NEO you hold. This amounts to an annual return of about 2%.

Note that the GAS in NEO is its native token and is different from the gas fees usually paid in Ethereum.

VeChain (VET)

VeChain is a blockchain project that was founded in 2015. It is a platform for smart contracts, similar to Ethereum and NEO. The project boasts of an eco-friendly and robust blockchain ecosystem.

The native coin of this project is VET , which is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. By holding the VET token in your wallet, you will be rewarded using VTHOR coins, another native token in the VeChain ecosystem.

Dividends are paid out quarterly and depend on how much you've staked. Currently, the payout rates for staking 1 VET stand at 0.00042 VTHORs, which translates to an APR of 1.4%.

Conclusion

So, does crypto pay dividends? The answer is yes! Although technically, by definition, they aren’t actually dividends. Instead, they are rewards paid out in cryptocurrency.

If you want to generate passive income from your crypto investments, any of these five options could work for you.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vZXhjbHVzaXZlcy9jb2lucy10aGF0LXBheS1jcnlwdG8tZGl2aWRlbmRzLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-08-31,"Lawmakers Probe Coinbase, Binance, FTX Over Crypto Fraud - Blockworks","key takeaways Five major cryptocurrency exchanges have been requested to submit documents to the US lawmakers

Federal agencies were asked whether crypto holdings should be treated as commodities, securities, or both

Nearly half a million people have lost more than $1 billion to crypto crime and fraud since the beginning of last year — a figure that’s now prompted a US House of Representatives committee to investigate how major exchanges such as Coinbase, FTX and Kraken operate.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who chairs an oversight committee on economic and consumer policy, sent letters to four federal agencies and five crypto exchanges on Tuesday, requesting information on the mechanisms they have in place to tackle fraud and scams.

His nine letters were sent to the US Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Binance.US, Coinbase, FTX, Kraken and KuCoin.

“The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers,” Krishnamoorthi wrote.

“For all these reasons, I am concerned about the growth of fraud and consumer abuse linked to cryptocurrencies.” The five crypto exchanges weren’t asked the same questions.

The Congressman highlighted the Department of Justice’s recent indictments to point to fraudulent coin offerings and sham investment platforms as examples of fraud.

Software developers have also taken advantage of heightened interest to create tokens, list them on exchanges and pump them before fleeing with investor funds, Krishnamoorthi noted.

Blockchain analytics platform Chainlysis estimates these so-called rug pulls made up about 37% of scam revenue in 2021 — a massive jump from just 1% in 2020.

Krishnamoorthi asked the agencies and companies to provide specific information that would assist Congress in drafting legislation aimed at stabilizing the industry, with a September 12 deadline.

“Should cryptocurrency holdings be treated as commodities, securities, or both? Please explain,” one of the questions asked. The matter has stirred debate especially since the SEC recently charged a former Coinbase product manager with insider trading, alleging that he purchased at least nine crypto tokens that classify as securities.

Krishnamoorthi’s request for information from the crypto industry highlights increasing steps taken by authoritative agencies to rein in firms working in the space.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday also warned of mounting instances where criminals are exploiting investor interest in cryptocurrencies. Data from Immunefi shows hacks against DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols resulted in losses over $1.2 billion in the first quarter, an almost eight-fold increase compared to the same time last year.

In July, Democrats sought information specifically from cryptocurrency miners. After arriving at “disturbing” findings into the environmental impact of crypto mining, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and US Rep. Rashida Tlaib were among six lawmakers who requested miners disclose their emissions and energy use.

2022-10-01,How to Detect Scam Crypto Projects? - CoinCodex,"The lack of regulations in the cryptocurrency space lends itself to innovation and the fast-paced development of new technologies. However, the lack of enforceable rules also creates ample opportunities for malicious actors to exploit unsuspecting users.

We can protect ourselves by learning the basics of detecting scam projects and thus avoid projects that look outright fraudulent. Praying on crypto novices is especially prevalent when it comes to the initial coin offerings (ICO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unfortunately plagued with scams.

As a rule of thumb, when evaluating projects’ credibility, one should scrutinize every investment decision and ensure that the cryptocurrency project they invest in produces value or some kind of solution to real-world problems. What matters most in new projects is what has been achieved in the past rather than promises.

Methods of Detecting Scam Projects

There are several red flags that should raise suspicion when evaluating crypto projects. A poorly written white paper, lack of a clear roadmap, team members with a poor reputation, and other similar things can be useful indicators when determining the trustworthiness of a particular blockchain project.

Diligent research and staying away from individuals with a questionable past can go a long way toward avoiding crypto scam projects. Remember, if things sound too good to be true, they probably are!

A detailed review of the roadmap

Crypto projects should have a roadmap that clearly and transparently states their goals and milestones step by step. You can view the roadmap as a to-do list for the progress of the project. The roadmap helps to see whether past goals have been achieved, and also gives an idea of ​​what could be accomplished in the future. It is a good idea to stay away from a project that had problems in achieving the goals in the past, or if there are goals that seem too difficult to reach in the future.

The Team Behind the Project

As the crypto world continues to grow, an increasing number of developers and business people are able to enter the market and run or launch new projects. Those who have no industry-related success in their past can also develop a thriving project by producing a good solution to a particular real-world problem. However, projects that consists of mostly unknown team members are usually more prone to turn out as scams.

A project is more reliable if the team, developers, and founders behind the project have run successful projects in the past. Every new project should have a section where it provides information about its team, and those on the team should have their own websites or LinkedIn profiles accessible. If that is not the case, it could be a giant red flag.

Does the Project Provide Real Value?

For a project to be successful, it must truly be a solution to a problem or provide real value to its users. There's not much reason for people to buy a crypto that won't do anything. It is necessary to stay away from projects that are simple and do not offer a solution to any problem. Also, projects that are solely focused on increasing their native token’s price should be avoided at all costs.

Founders in Contact with the Community

The founders of crypto projects often work on more than one project. In this case, they will be very busy and may not be able to communicate much with people in the community. But a good project deserves some attention. A passionate founder who trusts his project knows that connecting with the community is very important.

Even the founders of projects that are already well established in the market frequently interact with the community. Managers who want to announce the latest developments, innovations, and other news about the project ensure community participation by using communication channels as often as possible.

Especially “Ask Me Anything” events organized via Twitter and Discord are the things that we can get good information about the project's progress. If the founders are never there and you can't get answers to your questions, there may be a few problems with the project.

Common Crypto Scam Methods

As a rule of thumb, crypto scam projects belong to one of three groups – those that are simply Ponzi schemes, those that are rug pulls, and those that impersonate prominent individuals and organizations in the crypto sector to gain access to users’ funds. Let’s take a closer look at each method.

Ponzi Scheme

This familiar scam method, which exists in virtually every investment-related sector, is unfortunately very prevalent in crypto. Also known as the pyramid scheme, you are rewarded as you persuade more people to buy cryptocurrencies. The money of new users who invest in the project is used as payment for the people at the top of the pyramid. The project collapses when it cannot find new victims.

A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud that pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. Once no new investors join, the business model collapses, and the remaining investors are left with nothing.

Spotting a Ponzi is relatively easy. If a project promises you high returns in return for getting more investors, you can be sure that the project operates using Ponzi scheme mechanics.

Rug Pull

Rug pull is a type of scam that involves the disappearance of project managers taking everyone's assets. Although this type of scam is quite common, it is very difficult to detect. We mentioned that before investing in a project, we need to get information about the team behind it. It is challenging to realize that the project is a scam until the founders of the project walk away with the money.

Rug pull refers to a crypto scam in which a developer lures investors to a new project, then abandons them with a worthless currency before the project is completed.

If a project doesn't allow you to sell cryptocurrencies whenever you want, the project’s team may be waiting to pull the rug, walking away with investors' money. Illiquid and not easily traded crypto is a potential warning sign of a rug pull project.

Mysterious Tokens Sent to Your Wallet

Sometimes, tokens may come to our crypto wallets, and we have no clue from where, by whom, and for what purpose they were sent. Accounts making such transfers usually imitate the name of one of the successful projects in the market or have a website name. When you get curious and enter the website, you come across an interface where you can exchange tokens. If you link your wallet to that website, they will defraud you by withdrawing valuable funds from your wallet. Remember, you should be extra careful when transacting using your Web3 wallet. You should only connect your wallet to trusted websites.

The Biggest Crypto Scams in History

Over the past decade, numerous crypto scams defrauded victims out of billions of dollars. Here are some of the most notorious scams in crypto history.

OneCoin

OneCoin was promoting itself as a low-cost educational and banking institution. After a while, it turned out that the educational materials given to the investors were plagiarism. Investors could not trade all their cryptos due to daily selling limits. OneCoin, which was shut down after a while, defrauded users for $4 billion.

OneCoin was one of the most notorious scams in the history of cryptocurrency – the project turned out to be a Ponzi scheme that siphoned $4 billion from investors.

Pincoin

Pincoin, which introduced itself as a legal coin, convinced about 32,000 people and collected $765 million. Claiming that the funds are backed by gold, the company promised at least 150% return on investment per month for three months. In the end, the founder disappeared with users’ funds in what was one of the largest rug pulls in the history of crypto.

Bitconnect

Bitconnect, which witnessed one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history, stole $3.45 billion collected during the project’s ICO campaign. The victims were promised a 40% return per month and were ultimately left with nothing.

How Can We Protect Ourselves from Scams?

No matter how diligent, everybody can become a victim of a scam. However, the likelihood of that happening is drastically reduced if proper steps are taken.

Do Your Own Research (DYOR)

Doing your own research is essential to being able to make successful investment decisions and avoid scam projects consistently. Websites and social media accounts of projects can sometimes be full of fake comments. Fake comments created by one or more people do not offer real feedback on the project.

If you are interested in investing in a cryptocurrency project, see what users are talking about on the Telegram channel, read the whitepaper, Google the project's name and find shared posts, or join the discussions on the Discord server. While these steps may seem a little tedious to the eye, you can avoid potential long-term harm by undertaking them. Seeing real discussions by real people can give very good insights into the course of the project.

Common steps to take to avoid crypto scams:

Check the project website link. You may have accidentally clicked on a malicious ad.

Use two-factor authentication. Turn on multi-factor authentication on all platforms to keep your cryptocurrencies safe.

Check out the audits. In particular, the smart contract audits performed by CertiK give a good idea of ​​how robust the software used by the project is.

Avoid false promises of income. Stay away from projects that promise extreme price increases like 100x, 1000x, or 50% monthly ROI.

Conclusion

If you follow the steps outlined in this article while making an investment decision, your chance of being scammed will be surely minimized. Detecting and avoiding obvious crypto scams will ensure that you can survive with your capital intact. If, for whatever reason, a project seems suspicious to you, do not invest in that project. While that might seem extreme, it can be a good guideline if you feel unsure about pulling the trigger. Especially considering there are literally thousands of legitimate crypto projects that are worth investing in.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE5NjU0L2hvdy10by1kZXRlY3Qtc2NhbS1jcnlwdG8tcHJvamVjdHMv0gFKaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTk2NTQvaG93LXRvLWRldGVjdC1zY2FtLWNyeXB0by1wcm9qZWN0cy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-10-10,Helium Foundation Responds to Binance HNT Delisting - Cryptonews,"Helium Foundation Responds to Binance HNT Delisting

After major crypto exchange Binance said that it would cease trading Helium Network Token (HNT), the Helium Foundation COO reportedly stated that “there is no basis” for doing so and that the coin meets all the standards set by the exchange.

Four days ago, Binance announced that it would “remove and cease trading” certain spot, cross, and isolated margin pairs, specifically HNT/BTC, HNT/BUSD, HNT/USDT, and OOKI/BNB.

Cross and isolated margin borrowing was suspended just a day later, on October 7, while all users’ positions will be closed, an automatic settlement conducted, and all pending orders canceled on October 12.

“We will then delist the HNT/BUSD and HNT/USDT cross and isolated margin pairs,” the exchange said.

The announcement, however, did not provide any specific explanation for its decision.

Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung was quoted by Forbes as saying that the exchange periodically reviews each coin listed to “ensure that it continues to meet a high level of standard,” adding that:

“When a coin or token no longer meets this standard or there are changes in the industry, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it in order to protect our users.”

However, Scott Sigel, COO at the Helium Foundation, replied to the exchange in a statement to Forbes, stating that,

“There is no basis for Binance to delist several HNT pairs. There has been no change to the integrity of HNT and it continues to meet all of the standards the exchange sets.”

Sigel argued that “dozens of other exchanges” continue to support the coin, adding: “We hope Binance reverses course and re-lists the other HNT trading pairs soon.”

Forbes noted that Nova Labs, the founders of the Helium network, which is backed by major companies such as Andreessen Horowitz and Multicoin Capital, declined to comment on the record.

Could increasing regulations be behind this?

There was speculation about whether the exchange is making moves in response to the growing regulatory scrutiny – both of Binance and of the crypto industry in general – particularly from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it comes to the US. Binance was also previously accused of doing the opposite of what they preach – evading regulations. The exchange has denied these accusations.

Carol Van Cleef, chair of the Blockchain and Digital Assets practice at the law firm Bradley, told Forbes that exchanges delist coins for multiple reasons, “sometimes after being informed of an investigation or enforcement from an agency like the [SEC].”

She said,

Helium’s delisting is “going to attract attention and cause people to ask questions as to why.”

Others have also commented on the increasingly large eye of the regulator turning towards the industry. Poppy Alexander, a partner at Constantine Cannon, which represents SEC whistleblowers, told Forbes that,

“There have been rumors now for months that a big crypto regulatory push is coming,” and federal enforcement authorities are “very eager and smart and raring to go.”

Others questioned if Binance’s recent mistake could have something to do with it – though it’s unclear how the exchange would benefit from the latest move if that were the case. As reported, four Binance.us customers unexpectedly received a total of almost $22 million in crypto after the exchange had erroneously credited holders of Helium's new MOBILE token with the more valuable HNT instead.

Helium has seen its share of accusations as well: just recently, Forbes claimed that the executives at Helium, as well as their family, had hoarded the majority of wealth at the project's launch, saying that: “Helium has made a handful of people disproportionately rich: its executives and their friends.”

But Amir Haleem, Helium’s co-founder and CEO, was quoted as saying that “none of those numbers [cited by Forbes] feel unreasonable to me or egregious in any way.”

On Monday morning (8:40 UTC), HNT is trading at $4.52. It is down 1.4% in a day, 5.7% in a week, 3% in a month, and 77% in a year. It dropped nearly 92% from its all-time high recorded in November 2021.

Per Binance’s announcement, it also limited trading pairs for Ooki Protocol. At the end of September, The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Ooki’s founders and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a number of violations. You can learn more about it here.

Aptos will use the funds to expand its team and develop layer-1 infrastructure, Binance Labs said in a statement, without providing financial details of the investment.

2022-09-21,About 70% Of Indian Web3 Professionals Are Satisfied With Their Careers: Survey - BW Disrupt,"The report highlights, over 40 per cent of Indian Web3-interested professionals have shown a stronger passion for metaverse, NFT, and blockchain-based gaming space for employment, over-indexing the global average

KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency exchange today announces additional findings from the global survey report, 'Journey into Web3' revealing the increasing interest from the Indian youth to explore job opportunities in Web3 industry. The report highlights, over 40 per cent of Indian Web3-interested professionals have shown a stronger passion for metaverse, NFT, and blockchain-based gaming space for employment, over-indexing the global average.

With India progressing successfully towards the Web3 space, which is powered by digital engineering, around 41 per cent of Web3-interested professionals desire to work as developers in the space. This indicates the scope of job opportunities that Web3 is going to create for Indian youths. 72 per cent of Web3 professionals in India are satisfied with their careers currently and acknowledge the advantages of the industry, such as room for development and innovation as well as enhanced welfare. Additionally, 60 per cent of the Indian users surveyed who have never worked for Web3 are very interested in learning more about the field of employment, mostly driven by opportunities for professional advancement and a better compensation package in the sector.

Marketing, Research and Strategy are the most desired job functions in Web3 in India as over 45 per cent Web3-interested professionals are willing to join. As Web3 attracts the brightest minds, it will undoubtedly have a juggernaut effect, resulting in the creation of a decentralized Internet unlike anything we’ve ever seen before.

Unveiling the survey findings, Johnny Lyu, CEO, KuCoin said, “One of the most popular terms in the 2022 tech industry is ""Web3,"" which refers to the upcoming version of the internet that will be built on blockchain technology. KuCoin undertook this global study to gain insight how the youth in India has shown keen interest in the blockchain, Metaverse universe as a potential career path. The results of our ""Journey into Web3"" poll has also shown that women in India have a bright future in Web3 with increased interests from a diverse talent pool. In the near future, we anticipate seeing more Indians including women joining the web3 space, which will inertly strengthen India's whole Web3 ecosystem.”

Women play a major role in the Web3 space and according to the survey 30 per cent of surveyed Indians think that women contribute to Web3 workplace by thinking long-term and applying sustainable strategies in their work. 34 per cent think that the Web3 space lacks women-led communities which is a top challenge for women who are investing or working in the space. Other main challenges for women entering the Web3 space include the lack of Web3 educational resources (31%) and keeping up with evolving industry know-how (26%). Additionally, 25 per cent think that women worry about the instability and risks surrounding the Web3 space. Building more Web3 educational resources and communities for women are considered the most effective in encouraging women to join Web3. In India, it is particularly important to offer tangible rewards and benefits for female investors and employees as motivations to grow their presence in Web3.

Commenting on the survey, Medha B Dey Roy, Head of Branding, KuCoin India, said, “Indian women have enormous potential to disrupt the Web3 market. But compared to male-led Web3 groups, we found that there are less women-led communities. However, the survey reveals that women are valued for their abilities to develop trust in communities and workplaces, two factors essential to developing the Web3 culture. This means that women's honest, sympathetic leadership styles and long-term mindsets are more appreciated. These skill sets are vital and play a significant part in strengthening the Web3 ecosystem. Thus, at KuCoin we continuously strive to foster inclusivity and diversity by supporting talents across geographies.”

More than half of our surveyed respondents expressed interest in exploring Web3 as a career option, which is embraced for its unique benefits such as abundant space for innovation and professional growth, flexible work location and schedule, and above-the-average salary and welfare package.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwOi8vYndkaXNydXB0LmJ1c2luZXNzd29ybGQuaW4vYXJ0aWNsZS9BYm91dC03MC1PZi1JbmRpYW4tV2ViMy1Qcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxzLUFyZS1TYXRpc2ZpZWQtV2l0aC1UaGVpci1DYXJlZXJzLVN1cnZleS8yMS0wOS0yMDIyLTQ0NzUzNNIBjQFodHRwOi8vYndkaXNydXB0LmJ1c2luZXNzd29ybGQuaW4vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvQWJvdXQtNzAtT2YtSW5kaWFuLVdlYjMtUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFscy1BcmUtU2F0aXNmaWVkLVdpdGgtVGhlaXItQ2FyZWVycy1TdXJ2ZXkvMjEtMDktMjAyMi00NDc1MzQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-10-15,Blockwiz Aims to Uplift New Projects with its Cost-effective Crypto Influencer Campaigns | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist,"Blockwiz is a name trusted by many companies when it comes to data-driven digital marketing solutions in the Web3 industry. Creating a bridge between exceptional projects and appreciative customers is Blockwiz’s goal. The USP of Blockwiz is that it utilizes its trustworthy network of KOLs and crypto influencers to market cryptocurrency and Web3 projects for a reasonable price.

Prominently, Blockwiz believes in #FUDLESSmarketing, which projects exceptional trust in the market in this highly unreliable and unpredictable world of crypto. The agency is proud of its ability to not only survive but also thrive in bear markets and surprisingly perform the same miracle for each and every one of its clients.

Continuing the same legacy, Blockwiz launched something that is going to revolutionize the crypto industry, especially helping the new and blooming crypto projects.

Blockwiz’s Crypto Influencer Campaigns at Cost Price

Blockwiz took the market by surprise with its new marketing strategy, which is not only a bold move for any blockchain marketing company but will definitely help hundreds, if not thousands, of emerging crypto projects to attract deserving market attention.

Blockwiz is offering crypto influencer campaigns to emerging projects and brands at cost price that will pave the way to countless opportunities for small and even established brands to fully capitalize on.

We genuinely want new and sincere projects to reach the masses. We are prepared to assist meritorious projects in making connections with well-known KOLs and influencers who will 10x their visibility in the crypto space and help them spread the word.”

– Dev Sharma, Founder and CEO at Blockwiz

Result-driven Campaigns for Clients

Blockwiz is excited to celebrate its second anniversary with an official alliance with KuCoin, a year-long partnership with XLA and Mudrex, and an overview of the incredible achievements attained in this time with our strategically planned crypto influencer campaigns.

XLA

It was XLA’s task to identify important stakeholders, create a community from scratch, and advertise its “Founding Member” NFT Airdrop Campaign to early backers that Blockwiz was tasked with solving.

Blockwiz accepted the challenge head-on and developed a strategy to increase brand recognition to attract new users, engage existing users, and keep them on board while promoting their initial “Founding Members” NFT Airdrop.

Blockwiz partnered with various KOLs and influencers such as Crypto Bri, Matrix Guy, OxRocker, and Bitcoinbro.Eth to run Twitter and Discord influencer marketing campaigns which accumulated outstanding results, achieving more than 250K views with 160K+ impressions, 3K+ likes, and 1.5K+ link clicks.

Mudrex

Mudrex is among the best-automated crypto trading platforms bringing profitable solutions to the average investor. Now they are present in more than 100 countries and have $20M+ Assets under management. But initially, the challenge was to build the project’s brand image among the community and attract crypto investors.

As a result, Blockwiz assisted them in promoting their brand through KOL campaigns and influencer marketing, developing trust in the market, encouraging sign-ups, and organizing and implementing freebies to increase brand recognition and sales. The campaign was successful beyond expectations garnering 175K+ impressions, 7900+ likes, and more than 36K+ Sign-ups on the Mudrex Platform.

KuCoin

Blockwiz has been associated with KuCoin since 2021. Kucoin is among the world’s leading asset platforms, and its user base exceeds over 20 million across 70 countries. The challenge Blockwiz faced as a marketing agency was to identify Key-Opinion leaders (KOLs) in the market to reach the masses.

Blockwiz primarily focused on Sign-ups using a dedicated influencer marketing campaign, enabling KuCoin to achieve a milestone of 1 million user sign-ups. Along with driving new crypto enthusiasts to the KuCoin platform via a dedicated campaign focused on acquiring new users.

Before anything else, Blockwiz executed dedicated and promotional youtube campaigns with several well-known KOLs and mega-influencers, like Professor Crypto, Start Up Gyaan, Crypto Ciervo King, Mad Cripto, and Bitcoin Bro. Additionally, Blockwiz assisted in creating ecosystem-focused material for media mentions, which boosted organic user growth across all channels. These efforts generated 181K+ views on YouTube, 142K+ likes on Twitter, and 2000+ impressions on PR Mentions as early as the first week.

“We were anxiously looking for a marketing company, but with so many good possibilities, we were really perplexed. After much discussion, we chose to rely on Blockwiz. For our brand, Blockwiz proved to be an all-in-one solutions agency, which is what we were searching for. They helped us gain a significant competitive advantage, and we unquestionably credit Blockwiz for our success. The team is incredibly competent and accessible around-the-clock. We put our faith in them to handle our marketing and promotional requirements because we know they have the ability to propel us to the top of the success ladder.”

2022-10-14,$50B asset custody platform GK8 enters Brazil with license agreement - Cointelegraph,"Digital asset custody platform GK8 has partnered with 2ND Market, a Brazilian crypto holding company, to expand cryptocurrency product offerings in Brazil — a move both companies say would support continued adoption in Latin America’s largest economy.

Under the partnership agreement, GK8 will license its institutional-grade custody platform to 2ND Market to give Brazilian users access to a wider range of crypto products and services. In particular, 2ND Market will leverage GK8’s integration with MetaMask Institutional, a multi-custodial wallet, to provide users with access to decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 crypto assets.

Founded in 2018, GK8 reportedly manages roughly $50 billion of digital assets — up from $1 billion two years ago — and utilizes an air-gapped Cold Vault to eliminate cyber attacks. The company has established custody partnerships with the crypto trading platform INX, the Stellar blockchain network and the State Street-Backed Securrency, among others.

2ND Market operates as a technology ecosystem that is trying to bridge infrastructure and crypto usability. The holding company operates multiple entities that work together to support crypto integration and adoption in Brazil.

GK8 referenced a study by crypto exchange KuCoin showing an upsurge in Brazilian crypto adoption as a key reason for establishing the partnership. According to the KuCoin report, roughly 16% of Brazilians — over 34.5 million people — have exposure to digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). A separate report from the Gemini crypto exchange in April also concluded that Brazil was leading the world in terms of digital asset adoption.

Brazil is going deeper into CBDC with a new test from Mercado Bitcoin. https://t.co/F5FYMo9iLa — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 25, 2022

Crypto adoption in Brazil is growing on multiple fronts. Brazil’s tax authority recently reported that, as of August, over 12,000 companies had digital assets on their books. Meanwhile, Rio de Janeiro just announced that it would begin accepting crypto for property tax payments.

When asked about the state of crypto in Brazil, GK8's co-founder and CEO Lior Lamesh told Cointelegraph that soaring inflation and a collapsing local currency have both served as adoption drivers:

“With inflation at 10% and a weakening Brazilian real, it is no wonder why crypto adoption in Brazil stands at approximately 16%. In fact, Brazil is at #7 in the Chainalysis crypto adoption index, the highest-ranked country in South America, and not far behind the USA. We believe that macroeconomic winds will continue to drive adoption higher.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy81MGItYXNzZXQtY3VzdG9keS1wbGF0Zm9ybS1nazgtZW50ZXJzLWJyYXppbC13aXRoLWxpY2Vuc2UtYWdyZWVtZW500gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9uZXdzLzUwYi1hc3NldC1jdXN0b2R5LXBsYXRmb3JtLWdrOC1lbnRlcnMtYnJhemlsLXdpdGgtbGljZW5zZS1hZ3JlZW1lbnQvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-07,September Is the Weakest Month for Bitcoin Performance - CoinCodex,"Throughout history, cryptocurrencies have exhibited price movements in cycles related to the Bitcoin halving, hype, and general market conditions. While historical cycles do not allow us to accurately predict the future value of an asset, they can give us powerful clues—for example, we can learn that September is the weakest month in terms of BTC performance.

When we look at the monthly return of Bitcoin since it started trading, we can see that September has been the worst month for Bitcoin in general. Bitcoin has closed the month with a rise in only 2 of 9 Septembers since 2013. In September this year, there was a 6.68% decrease even before we were 7 days deep in the month. The bad news is that a bad month for BTC will likely turn into an even worse month for alts, as BTC is the barometer of the entire crypto market.

On the other hand, October and February are the strongest months in terms of BTC performance. 8 times in February and 7 times in October, Bitcoin closed the month with a rise.

Bitcoin's Historical Q3 Performance

Bitcoin has just emerged from the worst 2nd quarter in its history. BTC, which entered April at $45,750, ended June at a price of $18,950. That's more than 56% depreciation in a single quarter.

Looking at the 13-year average, the weakest quarter of the year for BTC is the third quarter. BTC, which averaged between 69% and 188% in other quarters, saw an average value increase of only 9.75% in the third quarter. The Q3's of 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2019 are the quarters where the price of Bitcoin fell.

What do you think will happen in the Bitcoin market? Let us know by participating in our Twitter poll.

What will happen in the $BTC markets first? — CoinCodex (@CoinCodex) September 7, 2022

Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 Index

September is usually also a tough month for the S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 Index fell in September for 51 of the 93 years since 1928, with an average return of -1,08%. The weakest months following September are February with -0.12% and May with -0.04%. No other months average a negative return. The conventional wisdom for the general market decline in September is that investors want to take their profits and meet their cash needs as the year-end approaches.

While Q3 performance looks bad overall, the good news is that September is followed by October, one of the best months for stocks, and BTC is expected to imitate stock market moves. Since the pandemic began, BTC price has largely mirrored the S&P 500 Index performance. If governments' monetary policies get the green light, both the stock market and Bitcoin could make investors happy in October.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE4ODgxL3NlcHRlbWJlci1pcy10aGUtd2Vha2VzdC1tb250aC1mb3ItYml0Y29pbi1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS_SAV5odHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xODg4MS9zZXB0ZW1iZXItaXMtdGhlLXdlYWtlc3QtbW9udGgtZm9yLWJpdGNvaW4tcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Uv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-16,Exchange thousands of tokens with newly launched Changelly DeFi Swap - Cointelegraph,"Throughout seven years of operating on the market, Changelly has been well-known as an aggregator of centralized exchanges (CEX). The list of our CEX partners includes OKX, Kucoin, FTX, Huobi and many others. Such a variety of liquidity sources makes it possible for us to find the best offers among centralized exchanges and provide better rates to our users.

As so-called decentralized finance (DeFi) applications boomed in the summer of 2020, the market has pivoted toward a new direction. DeFi makes financial products and services available to everyone who has access to the internet. Moreover, it helps eliminate third-party involvement in people’s businesses and private lives by creating fully secure and anonymous financial services. Next, DeFi empowers users to truly own their funds and utilize various tools to lend, borrow, stake, earn interest and more.

We are thrilled to announce that we are taking the first step toward introducing DeFi possibilities to our users with Changelly DeFi Swap powered by Yet Another DeFi.

Yet Another DeFi is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that encompasses all the advantages of DeFi and optimizes transaction costs. The Smart Router by YAD finds the best way for a swap among different liquidity providers and suggests the most beneficial split to proceed with the transaction.

What does this integration mean to our users?

1,000+ available tokens

Best rates via DeFi

Lower transaction costs compared to industry leaders.

At present, any user can swap various Ethereum-based assets with just a few clicks. However, many more chains will become available in the near future, including BNB Chain, Solana, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Tron and others.

The Changelly team is committed to the goal of becoming the leading CEX and DEX aggregator on the market. We believe our seven-year experience of working with CEXs combined with limitless opportunities of DEXs will make it possible to provide even better rates and lower fees to our users. With the integration of DEXs, we get one step closer to enabling seamless anything-to-anything swaps, regardless of blockchain, wallet connector, etc.

Is it safe to use KuCoin in the US?

Kucoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.

However, it’s regulatory status is a little murky and that causes a lot of troubles and uncertainty for US users who keep wondering if they can trade on Kucoin from the US.

Visit KuCoin Now

Right off the bat – you can use KuCoin from the US. You don’t need to KYC for deposits and withdrawals. KYC on KuCoin is needed for larger withdrawals, higher leverages on futures trading and some DEFI services.

However, the exchange is not registered or regulated in the US so keeping too much crypto on it is very risky as they can freeze American accounts over night in case US authorities come after them.

Best way to withdraw funds from Kucoin for US users



You can’t use a US debit card or bank transfer to withdraw money from Kucoin. So you need to cash out with a workaround.

Convert your Kucoin funds into one of the low-fees, high speed coins like XLM, XRP or NANO.

Then send them to either Binance.US or Kraken or Coinbase to cash out to your credit card or bank account.

How to use Kucoin from the US

One way to use KuCoin in the US is just like you would use any other exchange with one extra step:

Use a US approved and regulated exchange as your on ramp for USD. We recommend Coinbase or Kraken

Then send the crypto of your choice to KuCoin and convert it to USDT

MISTAKE TO AVOID:



When withdrawing money from Kucoin, don’t withdraw USDT, withdraw some other coin. People are having their accounts frozen when they try to withdraw USDT. We are not sure why is this happening, but it is something we noticed while researching other US users’ experiences with KuCoin.

Use Kucoin it with VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows you to securely browse the internet while hiding your IP address and location. This way, you can bypass geoblocking restrictions and gain access to restricted content. It’s a great tool for accessing blocked sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.

In addition to blocking censorship, a VPN also encrypts your data. So even if someone sniffs out your traffic, they won’t be able to read it. For example, if you’re trying to buy drugs online, a VPN ensures the transaction goes smoothly.

We recommend using a VPN because it provides extra security against censorship and surveillance. We also recommend using a VPN provider that offers servers in multiple countries worldwide.

How to Use and Trade on KuCoin in the US with a VPN?

Trading on KuCoin is simple and quick. Here is a step-by-step tutorial to have you up and running in no time.

Obtain a VPN. ExpressVPN is a good example due to its strong security features and extensive server network, which lets you trade from anywhere. Connect to a European server. Most European nations allow trading on KuCoin, however, we suggest the UK. Sign up for a KuCoin account. Sign up for KuCoin using your name, email address, and a password of your choice. Inspect your account. Click on the activation link after checking your email. Check your spam box if you can’t locate it there. Ensure everything is verified. You must provide a photo of your ID card, passport, or driver’s license to complete the KYC procedure. Install 2FA. On your phone, install Google Authenticator. For iOS and Android devices, it may be found at the PlayStore. After that, set up the authenticator and make a note of the secret key. Trade on KuCoin now! You’re now prepared to follow the newest developments in cryptocurrency.

How to get wrecked on KuCoin:



– Trade with high leverage

– Use their API with unsafe third-party tools

– Send coins via wrong chain option when withdraw/deposit

2022-10-26,Dash 2 Trade Signals Platform Raises $2.5 Million in Presale – How ... - Cryptonews,"Dash 2 Trade Signals Platform Raises $2.5 Million in Presale – How to Buy?

Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.

The Dash 2 Trade presale has raised over $2.5 million only a week after beginning. This puts it halfway towards completing the second stage of its sale, at which point its price will rise from 0.05 USDT to 0.0513 USDT.

Based on Ethereum, Dash 2 Trade is a trading intelligence platform that provides its users with real-time analytics and social trading signals for the cryptocurrency market. It's due to launch in the first quarter of 2023, which is when its native D2T token will list on exchanges, potentially making a sizeable profit for its early investors.

Dash 2 Trade Signals Platform Raises $2.5 Million in Presale – How to Buy?

Dash 2 Trade's presale will occur over nine stages, with the current (second) stage due to end once $5,166,000 has been raised. This is likely to happen fairly soon, given that it has already raised over $2.5 million in a week.

Interested investors can participate in the presale simply by heading over to dash2trade.com and connecting their wallets. From there, they can purchase D2T using either ETH or USDT.

As of writing, 1 D2T costs 0.05 USDT, although this price will rise to 0.0513 USDT once the third stage begins. It will also rise with each new stage it enters.

There's a good chance Dash 2 Trade will progress through the various stages of its sale quickly since its fundamentals have attracted investors in a big way. That's because its trading intelligence platform will feature a range of tools that will make investment easier for beginner and experienced traders alike, including:

Buy and sell signals that help traders time market entries and exits

Social sentiment and on-chain monitoring in order to identify trending tokens

Social trading and strategy-building tools that help investors build portfolios based on proven principles

Access to new cryptocurrency presales, as well as new listing alerts

Taken as a whole, these tools will make navigating the turbulent cryptocurrency market more manageable for many traders. And while they sound good in theory, the Dash 2 Trade team also has the experience and expertise to realize them since the platform has developed out of the already-successful Learn2Trade forex intelligence platform.

Learn2Trade currently serves -- and draws insights from -- a community of over 70,000 active forex traders. However, with cryptocurrency arguably being a bigger draw for retail traders than the foreign exchange market, there's every chance that Dash 2 Trade could go on to accumulate an even bigger community than this.

Indeed, it's encouraging to note that Dash 2 Trade has now passed over 31,000 followers on Twitter since it opened an account last month. This highlights the strong community demand for a comprehensive tool such as Dash 2 Trade and also suggests that it could go on to grow strongly once it launches.

Big Returns Post-Presale

According to Dash 2 Trade's roadmap, it plans to begin listing D2T on exchanges from the first quarter of next year. This is when early investors can hope to secure profits from their participation in the presale.

Every presale and altcoin is different, but as an example of the kind of returns the savviest investors might potentially make, Tamadoge (TAMA) recorded gains of 1,800% at one point after it listed on OKX in early October. The metaverse-based meme token had previously raised $19 million in its presale, meaning that it's roughly of the size Dash 2 Trade will be once its respective sale ends.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9kYXNoLTItdHJhZGUtc2lnbmFscy1wbGF0Zm9ybS1yYWlzZXMtMjUtbWlsbGlvbi1wcmVzYWxlLWhvdy1idXkuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-02,Cybercrime Investigators Probing Oligarch Use of Crypto to Dodge ... - OCCRP,"As feared by Western governments, Russian oligarchs have begun using cryptocurrency to evade sanctions brought in response to the war in Ukraine.

""It is plain oligarchs are utilizing digital assets to evade sanctions,” says Rich Sanders. (Photo: Jernej Furman, Flickr, License)Rich Sanders, founder of cybercrime investigations firm CipherBlade, told OCCRP blockchain analysts are currently looking into the financial interests of wealthy Russian nationals recently targeted with restrictive economic measures.

“A lot of this touches on ongoing investigations ─ whether government or criminal probes, or compliance investigations launched as a result of alerts from transaction-analysis tools,” he said. “But what I can say is that it is plain oligarchs are utilizing digital assets to evade sanctions.”

Earlier in July the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT), a collaboration between law enforcement and the financial sector in the U.K., issued a red alert stating it was “likely” designated individuals would explore alternative payment methods, “including the use of crypto-assets,” to mitigate reduced access to the global financial system.

The group’s warning came after several U.S. representatives, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, in March submitted a bill proposing measures specifically targeting use of crypto assets by designated Russian nationals.

“No one can argue that Russia can evade all sanctions by moving its assets into crypto,” Warren said at the time. “But for Putin’s oligarchs who are trying to hide, you know, a billion or two of their wealth, crypto looks like a pretty good option.”

Previously there had been little confirmation of targeted individuals using digital assets to dodge economic restrictions imposed in response to the Russian invasion. Sanders told OCCRP about some of the methods firms like CipherBlade, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges conducting blockchain analysis, have seen being used in recent months.

“People have it in their heads that these oligarchs are going to be using shady brokers to transact millions or tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin or stablecoins at once,” he said. Instead, targeted individuals may turn to semi-professionalised laundering networks to manage often complex series of transfers on their behalf.

This isn’t without precedent. “Russian money launderers have increasingly been observed in U.K. intelligence and operational activity providing cash to crypto-asset services, with the ability to move significant volumes of funds,” according to JMLIT’s July statement.

Sanders explains members of those networks might start by dividing the initial amount into smaller parcels in order to avoid attracting too much attention ─ similar to “smurfing” in traditional finance, which refers to breaking up large transactions to keep them below reporting thresholds.

They might then use a technique called chain-hopping ─ often involving the use of instant swap exchanges, platforms that allow the transfer of value from one virtual coin to another ─ to move money between cryptocurrencies hosted on different blockchains.

“Basically, they’re doing a whole bunch of layering and structuring, making it incredibly difficult to follow the money,” Sanders said. “They realize that the resources required to combat the laundering of a few thousand dollars at a time are almost not worth it, and that’s how they’re getting away with it.”

Another method widely favored by crypto-launderers is the use of virtual currency mixers, which obscure the path of funds by jumbling up data on the origin, destination and parties to different transactions.

The United States has sanctioned two such platforms since the beginning of this year for allegedly laundering virtual assets stolen by Pyongyang-backed hackers, most recently the Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash.

Since launching in August 2019, Tornado Cash has mixed more than US$7.6 billion worth of Ether. Almost 30% of those funds have been tied back to illicit actors, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, while Bloomberg recently reported that some 52% of all proceeds from NFT scams went through the mixer before it was sanctioned.

“Tornado Cash effectively enabled literally hundreds of millions of dollars to go through to North Korea’s nukes,” said Sanders. “That’s a huge issue, and should not have gone on as long as it did.”

Nevertheless, the Treasury Department’s decision to designate the platform has created a degree of confusion within the wider cryptocurrency community. “There’s a huge uproar in the crypto-space right now,” explains Yaya Fanusie, a former CIA analyst and founder of Cryptocurrency AML Strategies.

“The complication has arisen: can you sanction computer code? And what about the innocent people who have been using the mixer? Is their crypto now sanctioned too?” he added.

One of Tornado cash’s developers has reportedly been detained by Dutch authorities, sparking debate over the culpability of the mixer’s decentralized development team for the way authorities claim the platform was misused.

Meanwhile, an anonymous user has exploited the lack of regulatory clarity to troll a number of U.S. brands and celebrities by implicating them in potential sanctions violations. In the aftermath of its designation, a slew of Tornado Cash transactions were reportedly sent to wallets controlled by clothing brand Puma, as well as TV host Jimmy Fallon and comedian Dave Chappelle.

Sanders speculates that increased scrutiny may see crypto-launderers moving away from the use of mixers, relying more on chain-hopping facilitated by instant swap exchanges, and that this will be reflected in the pattern of transactions linked to sanctioned Russian actors.

“You’re going to see even more illicit money, including oligarch money, going through platforms like KuCoin, OKX and Huobi. I mention them specifically because they’re historically the worst offenders,” he said. “Their background checks are defeatable, and their anti-money laundering programs have proven nothing more than virtue-signaling.”

“I’m not making this up, I’ve dressed as Osama bin Laden, Borat and Taylor Swift and been onboarded to those exchanges,” he added.

KuCoin, OKX and Huobi did not respond to requests for comment on their procedures for conducting background checks on users.

Overall, Sanders says, it’s disturbing the ease with which crypto-laundering networks can move money on behalf of individuals and entities subject to international sanctions.

“As someone who investigates this stuff for a living, I could (but obviously won’t) hypothetically red-team this and tell you how to launder hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets for an oligarch and not get caught,” he said.

“That’s terrifying to me. I should not be able to say that so confidently and easily, but it’s where we’re at right now,” he added.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jY3JwLm9yZy9lbi9kYWlseS8xNjcyNi1jeWJlcmNyaW1lLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtcHJvYmluZy1vbGlnYXJjaC11c2Utb2YtY3J5cHRvLXRvLWRvZGdlLXNhbmN0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

After months of running an incentivized testnet, the Aptos team launched the mainnet yesterday

The first day of the Aptos mainnet saw users complain about slow transaction speeds, and the team close the Telegram and Discord community channels

Binance revealed that it will be listing Aptos (APT), the network’s native governance and utility token, tomorrow at 1:00 UTC

Launch of the Aptos mainnet draws criticism from the community

After several months in the making, Aptos Labs launched the Aptos mainnet on October 17. However, the launch didn’t go as smoothly as the Aptos team might have hoped for.

The Aptos blockchain, which should supposedly be capable of handling up to 160,000 transactions per second (TPS), has been clearing just 4 TPS, according to data available via Aptos Explorer at press time.

Doing a recap after 24 hours of the Aptos mainnnet going live, the Aptos team stated on Twitter that the Aptos blockchain has been operating “as expected”.

Day one update:

Today has been exciting. Thank you for all the support!



The Aptos network has been performing as expected and will see increased activity as ecosystem projects onboard and get going. — Aptos (@AptosLabs) October 18, 2022

However, several users on social media pointed out that the Aptos media channels were disabled following the launch, which made it difficult for Aptos users to share their technical issues with the broader community. The Aptos team addressed the concerns and said that was done to “protect the community from scams” during the opening stages of the mainnet launch.

Binance to list Aptos (APT) token trading pairs on October 19

Following the mainnnet launch, the Binance cryptocurrency exchange announced that it will be listing Aptos (APT) on October 19, with the first spot and margin trading pairs going live at 1:00 UTC. The exchange also said that APT withdrawals will commence a day after the listing, at 1:00 UTC on October 20.

Here’s a list of trading pairs that will enable investors to trade APT:

What is Aptos blockchain?

Aptos blockchain is a Layer 1 project developed by a team of software developers and blockchain experts that previously worked on Meta’s Diem stablecoin project. The chain uses Move language, the low latency Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus approach, and virtual machine (MoveVM) for dApp development.

The highly scalable blockchain has managed to reach up to 160,000 TPS in controlled environments, making the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain a good option for services that require high throughput, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.

In two funding rounds conducted earlier this year, the Aptos team secured $350 million in total from a number of prominent crypto investors, including a16z, FTX Ventures, and Jump Crypto.

According to blockchain research firm Coin98 Analytics, the Aptos ecosystem consists of more than a hundred Web3 projects across NFT, DeFi, and gaming sectors.

Congratulations to the #Aptos mainnet.

Aptos tokenomics

APT is the native governance and utility token of the Aptos network, used as the primary asset for network fees and validator staking.

According to a post made by the Aptos Foundation yesterday, the initial Aptos token supply was 1 billion. It is worth noting that the supply of the Aptos token is slated to increase beyond 1.5 billion tokens by 2031, accounting for network performance and staking assumptions presented in the Aptos Foundation’s post.

Initial Aptos token distribution:

Community - 51.02%

Core contributors - 19.00%

Foundation - 16.50%

Investors - 13.48%

At the moment, 82% of the total Aptos crypto supply is locked in staking pools and will be released gradually over the coming months in accordance with the distribution schedule.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjk1L2FwdG9zLWxhdW5jaGVzLW1haW5uZXQtYmluYW5jZS10by1saXN0LWFwdC1vbi1vY3RvYmVyLTE5L9IBYGh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjk1L2FwdG9zLWxhdW5jaGVzLW1haW5uZXQtYmluYW5jZS10by1saXN0LWFwdC1vbi1vY3RvYmVyLTE5Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-10-13,TeraWulf Increases Operating Capacity Beyond 1.6 EH/s as Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All Time High - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

TeraWulf, a Bitcoin mining company relying primarily on zero-carbon energy sources, has boosted its New York facility’s operating capacity to over 1.6 EH/s

The move comes at a time when Bitcoin mining difficulty is at an all-time high and profit margins slim

The company plans to bring its total computing capacity to 5.8 EH/s in Q1 2023, in part thanks to energy provided by Susquehanna Nuclear Station in Pennsylvania

Bitcoin Miner announced a few days ago that it had increased the operating capacity for its Lake Mariner Bitcoin facility above 1.6 exahashes per second (EH/s). This is a major milestone for the Bitcoin (BTC) miner, which is planning to have an operating capacity of 5.8 EH/s by the end of Q1 2023.

In a tweet announcing the development, the company announced that it plans to increase operating capacity to 2.8 EH/s by the end of the year. “We’re thrilled to announce we have expanded our operating capacity to exceed 1.6 EH/s at our Lake Mariner facility in Upstate New York and our expected near-term self-mining operating capacity to 3.8 EH/s,” the tweet reads.

We’re thrilled to announce we have expanded our operating capacity to exceed 1.6 EH/s at our Lake Mariner facility in Upstate New York and our expected near-term self-mining operating capacity to 3.8 EH/s!#ZeroCarbon #Bitcoin



Continue Reading:https://t.co/eFQ47PgYKA — TeraWulf (@TeraWulfInc) October 10, 2022

The increased TeraWulf mining operating capacity is due to the full energization of Building 1 at the Lake Mariner facility. It added that work is ongoing to ensure the full energization of Building 2 is complete by the end of the year.

Terawulf Bitcoin miner is one the leading clean-energy miner in the United States and stated that it is currently developing the Nautilus Cryptomine facility in partnership with Talen Energy Corp. When the facility is complete, it will have access to as much as 300 MW of bitcoin mining capacity from the Susquehanna Nuclear Station in Pennsylvania. This will ensure it meets its projected mining capacity of 5.8 EH/s in Q1 2023.

Following the announcement on October 10, TeraWulf stock saw a slight rise, reaching $1.41. But it has declined since then and traded at $1.13 at the close of the markets on October 11. Regardless of WULF's performance, TeraWulf remains bullish on mining bitcoin and, like several other miners, is taking advantage of the current market conditions to expand its capacity.

Since the bear markets started, Bitcoin miners have found their pockets tighter due to less liquidity, forcing some to sell Bitcoin or even facilities. But a few are taking advantage of the market decline to expand their crypto mining business. Miners like CleanSpark have spent millions acquiring facilities and bitcoin mining rigs from competitors.

Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable?

Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new blocks on the Bitcoin network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles using ASIC machines. For validating transactions and creating new blocks, the miners get a certain number of Bitcoin as a reward. It is currently 6.25 BTC but will halve in May 2024 and reduce to 3.125 BTC. The halving happens every four years until the last of the 21 million Bitcoin is mined in 2140.

What is Bitcoin mining?

Mining is a capital and energy-intensive operation. But the high value of Bitcoin over the years has made the cost of operation worthwhile. Now, the bear market has caused a price decline, resulting in high pressure on miners to be profitable. Since the bear market started, several miners have sold most of their Bitcoin holdings to meet their cost of production and free up liquidity and service debts.

What usually determines whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is its cost of production. If the cost of production is lower than the current price, then it can be assumed that mining is profitable. However, it is not easy to determine the cost of production. Several factors usually come to play, such as the cost of equipment and energy used for mining. Since these costs, especially electricity, can vary across locations, the cost of production usually varies too.

But it is easy to tell whether miners are comfortable or not by looking at their selling behavior. Miners usually sell in the bull market and keep mined coins in the bear market. But if miners are selling in the bear market as many have done in this particular one, it is a sign that the mining costs are high, and they're selling to remain operational and continue mining.

When Will the Last Bitcoin Be Mined?

This appears to be the case in the current market, where the mining hash rate and mining difficulty continue to increase even though the price is falling. According to CoinMarketCap, the cost of a Bitcoin is currently $19,000. Despite the low price, the hash rate, which is the computing power of the network, is at 277.92M TH/s as of October 11. By comparison, the hash rate when Bitcoin was at its peak in November 2021 was around 170M TH/s.

5-year Bitcoin mining difficulty chart. Image source. YCharts

Since the hash rate determines the mining difficulty, which is how complex it is to solve the cryptographic puzzle needed to create a block, Bitcoin mining difficulty has also increased. It was at 35.61T on October 11, which is an all-time high and far above the 21.66 T on November 10, 2021, when Bitcoin peaked.

All these points to one thing, more miners are competing to solve more difficult puzzles to create a block and get the 6.25 BTC reward. As of July 2022, the cost of mining a Bitcoin was $13,000. But that has increased, along with the hash rate and mining difficulty. While the actual costs presently might vary, it is certain Bitcoin mining is not as very profitable presently. But miners still doubling down on expansion and production suggests that most are not running at a loss or have enough liquidity to survive the current market conditions.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMTIzL3RlcmF3dWxmLWluY3JlYXNlcy1vcGVyYXRpbmctY2FwYWNpdHktYmV5b25kLTE2LWVoLXMtYXMtYml0Y29pbi1taW5pbmctZGlmZmljdWx0eS1oaXRzLUFUSC_SAYIBaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAxMjMvdGVyYXd1bGYtaW5jcmVhc2VzLW9wZXJhdGluZy1jYXBhY2l0eS1iZXlvbmQtMTYtZWgtcy1hcy1iaXRjb2luLW1pbmluZy1kaWZmaWN1bHR5LWhpdHMtQVRILw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-26,What is the Ethereum Merge and What Has It Brought Us? - Bitrates,"Ethereum's merge has been described as the most significant upgrade in blockchain history. Let's look closely at the merge and what it brings us.

This upgrade represents a fundamental shift in the form of the blockchain's algorithm and consensus mechanism and begins a new generation in terms of ETH sustainability.

What is The Merge?

The Merge is what combines Beacon Chain with the PoS algorithm and Ethereum Mainnet. With this merge, Ethereum has moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake. PoW and PoS are the two most popular consensus mechanisms favored by blockchains. Proof-of-work is the algorithm of Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency. This algorithm is basically like a race between nodes to be the first to solve a mathematical puzzle. This puzzle becomes more difficult to solve as more miners join the network. This energy-intensive algorithm, which uses computing power, consumes excessive electricity and causes problems such as high cost and slowness.

Proof-of-stake is an algorithm that allows validators who stake their coins to validate transactions with this method. Staked coins are permanently committed on the mainnet for a long period of time. The staking process, initiated by staking at least 32 ETH, cannot be terminated until the Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum is completed. After that upgrade, every user will be able to stake and withdraw their funds at any time. Staked ETHs have an average annual return of 4%.

The idea of ​​moving to PoS, which was put forward by Vitalik Buterin in December 2020 and accepted by the community, has continued since then with improvements to Beacon Chain and testnets. In September 2022, The Merge took place, and the consensus mechanism of the network was completely changed. The Ethereum mainnet currently has over 400,000 validators and over $24 billion TVL.

The Importance of The Merge

The Merge has addressed and resolved many issues that Ethereum urgently needs to be resolved.

Decentralization

PoW miners pool their computing power in a consortium to increase their chances of earning mining rewards. If the consortium wins the computational contest, the prize is distributed to the consortium members. This leads to backlog and centralization to some mining pools and nodes. The network will become more decentralized as there is no such process in PoS.

Power Consumption

The PoW algorithm is based on mining by using computing power and consuming energy. More powerful machines and higher electricity consumption lead to more rewards. According to various studies, Ethereum used to consume the same amount of electricity as some European countries such as Belgium. Consuming 110 terawatt hours of electricity per year, Ethereum will now consume 99.9% less electricity, consuming 0.04% terawatts of electricity.

Access

Mining Ethereum required mining rigs running multi-rig connectivity, high-power GPUs, specialized cooling rigs, and highly technical knowledge to run complex software. Now, anyone with 32 ETH and a computer with standard hardware can become a validator on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, when you stop mining, you will not have expensive equipment whose value decreases.

Security

Decentralization and increased access make the network more secure. Distributing the validation among more nodes will raise Ethereum's Nakamoto Coefficient. This greatly prevents more than 50% of the network from voting down on a proposal that would exploit security.

Future Planned Upgrades of Ethereum

The first and most important step in future planned upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain was The Merge. The next upgrade of the network will be Shanghai.

The Shanghai upgrade is the one that will effectively lower Ethereum gas prices. The update, which will also affect the EVM object format, is expected to take place in early 2023. With this update, ETH stakers will be able to withdraw their ETH at any time.

The Surge upgrade will bring shadow chain rollups to the network, a method developed to scale Ethereum.

The Verge upgrade will optimize Ethereum's storage and reduce node sizes.

The Purge upgrade will reduce the number of space validators must have on their hard drives. Some unnecessary things taking up space on the chain will be cleaned up to simplify the Ethereum protocol.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpdHJhdGVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Avd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtZXRoZXJldW0tbWVyZ2UtYW5kLXdoYXQtaGFzLWl0LWJyb3VnaHQtdXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-08,Our Binance FAQ Part 8: 5 Questions About Binance - Altcoin Buzz,"We keep answering popular questions about Binance for you. With so many worldwide users, it’s no surprise that users have questions. Lots of questions. This is already part 8 and there’s more to come.

You can look up our first Binance FAQ and take it from there. So, let’s look into five new Binance questions.

Binance and Bitcoin

Binance and Bitcoin have a special relationship. For starters, they are both #1 in their field. Binance is the biggest exchange and Bitcoin is the OG and biggest cryptocurrency. Binance also offers no less than 13 BTC trading pairs and zero-fee trading.

As a result, Bitcoin has a big share of the daily trading volume on Binance. Let’s have a look at the three most popular BTC trading pairs.

BTC/USDC is 1.30%

BTC/BUSD is 9.74%

BTC/USDT is 31.26%

The percentages are the share in trading volume. So, with the three most popular BTC trading pairs, BTC has a 42.3% market share of daily trading volume on Binance.

With the same three stablecoins, Ethereum has a 17.53% market share and comes in second spot.

Binance and Tether

Tether or USDT is currently the most popular stablecoin. Stablecoins are a good hedge when the market is volatile. You can park your assets in a stablecoin and change back once the market stabilizes.

Sending and withdrawing Tether from Binance happens a lot. It must be one of the busiest ways to send crypto to or from Binance. As a result, Binance offers USDT transfers on 8 different blockchains. Each chain has a different price they charge per transaction. Here are the 8 chains.

Ethereum

BSC — BEP 20 tokens on the BNB chain

Avalanche — the AVAXC chain

BNB — BEP 2 tokens on the Beacon chain



Polygon

Solana

Tezos — the most recent addition

Tron — TRC 20 tokens

Binance also offers 10% interest on flexible savings on Tether. Up to $2,000 are eligible for this interest rate. Between $2,000 and $20,000 you receive 2% and above $20,000 it’s 0.30%.

Is Binance Like Robinhood?

Binance is quite different compared to Robinhood. For starters, Binance Global services around 180 countries. On the other hand, Robinhood is only for US customers. Binance is not allowed to trade in the US. However, Binance.US is an affiliate of Binance, so US citizens can trade at Binance.US. We already wrote a comparison between Binance and Binance.US.

Binance Global offers over 350 coins and over 1460 trading pairs.

Binance.US offers over 130 and almost 200 trading pairs. Robinhood offers only 7 cryptocurrencies.

Both Binance platforms allow you to move your crypto off the exchange. You can send it to any other wallet you have in mind. Robinhood doesn’t allow this. You can’t take your crypto off their platform. Instead, you need to cash out your tokens, and now you send the funds to an external account. This is a vital difference. You do not maintain full control over your coins.

Robinhood and Binance.US are regulated financial institutions in the US. Binance has some of the lowest fees in the crypto space. Robinhood offers free crypto transactions. However, they don’t trade on their own platform. As a result, they receive a commission from the platform they trade with. Robinhood also offers trading in stocks. Binance only offers crypto.

Robinhood is a broker for stocks and 7 cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, Binance is a crypto exchange.

Binance or Crypto.com?

Binance offers lower fees and more coins compared to Crypto.com. The one thing that Crypto.com stands out for, is its Visa card with up to 5% cashback. This is a prepaid card, which is like a debit card. So, you need to top it up.

In the US, Crypto.com is only not available in Hawaii. Binance.US is not available in four states, Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont.

Binance offers better interest rates in general. However, if you stake the CRO on Crypto.com, your interest rates go up. They’re still not near to the Binance rates.

Binance is available in 180 countries, and Crypto.com in around 100. If you live outside the US, Binance is the better option. Inside the US, Crypto.com is a good and fair competitor for Binance.US. However, to get the best rates, you need to stake CRO. Both have a good safety record.

Binance or KuCoin?

KuCoin is one of the few exchanges that offer more cryptocurrencies than Binance. However, Binance still offers more trading pairs

In volume, Binance wins hands down, with 19x more daily volume. Binance also has 7.5x more daily visitors.

Both are safe exchanges. Both exchanges were the target of hackers. However, they both refunded all their customers. They also start with similar low fees. However, KuCoin offers better fees to large volume traders. Still, the overall fee structure of Binance is better.

KuCoin is listing more new tokens compared to Binance. KuCoin stands out with its free native trading bot. Binance has no native bot, and most bots on Binance are not free. They use third-party bots.

Binance and KuCoin are inaccessible for US citizens. However, Binance has its Binance.US affiliate. Overall, Binance offers better value.

2022-10-10,What Is Bloktopia? Part 2 - Altcoin Buzz,"This is Part 2 of an article series about Bloktopia. Here’s a link to Part 1.

This is a continuation article from our previous research on Bloktopia. Today, we’re looking at what Bloktopia is exactly and what its $BLOK token is.

We’ll teach you more about Bloktopia and how and where to buy the $BLOK token.

What Is Bloktopia?

To recap, Bloktopia is a metaverse project built on the Polygon Layer 2 network. It comprises a 21-story skyscraper that offers Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. Bloktopia hopes to create an immersive, engaging metaverse.

To do so, they’ve designed their metaverse to cater to users with an interesting variety of crypto experiences. Also, they aim to position their skyscraper as a content hub for information and entertainment. Moreover, they’re using an advanced 3D creation engine. This software will improve their project’s visuals and experiences.

With this, users of Bloktopia (A.K.A Bloktopians) can enjoy an array of benefits. These include earning revenue through:

Real Estate Ownership. Advertising. Playing Games. Building Networks etc.

But, you may ask: How stunning are these graphics you speak of?. Well, as they say, a picture speaks a thousand words. We’ll show you more than that. Feast your eyes on their video trailer below!

From the trailer above, you can see that Bloktopia is also working with some big names in blockchain and entertainment. It seems they’re really building an ecosystem here. But, how would they tie it all together? The short answer – Using a token of course!

What Is the $BLOK Token?

Bloktopia has a native ERC-20 token called $BLOK. However, $BLOK is also available on Polygon. $BLOK tokens can be used for:

Purchasing items within Bloktopia’s metaverse, such as virtual real estate or other NFTs. This process is known as “Reblok”. Real estate is available for leasing or flipping for profit. Rewarding Bloktopians from advertising revenue. This process is known as “Adblok”. Advertisers who pay for ad space within Bloktopia will pay $BLOK rewards. A portion of this revenue goes to rewarding Bloktopians. Participating in governance and staking. Accessing exclusive events and pre-sales.

Indeed, Bloktopia has just held their Reblok land sale! An interesting fact is that all $BLOK tokens used in the sale will be burnt. Such deflationary pressures usually improve a token’s price appreciation.

The REBLOK Land Sale portal is now open 🥳 Buy prime NFTs on Level 1 of Bloktopia in virtual stores such as @jakepaul @TheBinanceNFT @enjin & @Cointelegraph 💰Got $BLOK? Buy REBLOK here: https://t.co/aRYWUoAT3S 🔥Remember, 100% of $BLOK used to purchase NFTs will be burnt! — Bloktopia | We're Hiring! (@bloktopia) October 3, 2022

How to Buy Bloktopia’s $BLOK Token?

Now, if you’re interested in getting some $BLOK tokens for utility or investment, keep reading on. We’re gonna teach you 2 methods on how to do just that:

Method #1 – Using Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) like Kucoin or MEXC. If you already have crypto on Kucoin or MEXC, buying $BLOK is easy. Just sell your crypto into $USDT. Then, use your $USDT to buy $BLOK. You can do so through the $BLOK/$USDT trading pairs for Kucoin or MEXC.

But, if you do not have any crypto on these exchanges yet, you could consider sending it over from your wallet or other CEXs. Otherwise, you could buy $USDT from Kucoin through their “Fast Trade” option as well. They’ve got plenty of payment partners to choose from. Once you’ve gotten your $USDT, you could then trade it for your $BLOK tokens! Method #2 – Using Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) like Quickswap. To use a DEX like Quickswap, you need to have $MATIC (for gas fees) and $USDT on your Metamask Wallet first.

Then, check the contract address for $BLOK. You can do so on their Coingecko page. Ensure you’ve input the $BLOK token’s contract address (0x229b1b6c23ff8953d663c4cbb519717e323a0a84) in the input field below. Now, you can swap your $USDT for $BLOK tokens.

Congratulations! Now you’ve got yourself some $BLOK tokens. They’re now either in your CEX wallet or in your Polygon Metamask wallet!

Where to Buy Bloktopia’s $BLOK Tokens?

In the above 2 methods, we’ve already discussed 3 places to get $BLOK tokens. For all exchanges supporting $BLOK, refer to their Coingecko Markets page. From here, you’d be guided on where $BLOK tokens are traded. See the below screenshot for $BLOK token’s ready markets. These could include both CEXs or DEXs.

As a general guideline, look for exchanges offering:

Low Spread.

High Volume.

Green Trust Score.

All these help to ensure that you get an accurate price for your $BLOK tokens. With the list above, I would recommend you get $BLOK tokens from Kucoin or Quickswap.

Conclusion

In the 2nd part of this article, we’ve answered another 4 questions for Bloktopia. Indeed, the metaverse sector is slated for explosive growth. With so many projects working towards launch, it’ll be wise not to miss out on Bloktopia’s development.

The current BLOK price is $0.00331. Over the last 14 days, BLOK is up 10.8%. The market cap is $58 million. Out of the 200 billion BLOK tokens max supply, only 17.5 billion circulate. Once again, this is something to keep in mind.

2022-09-12,Rapidly Growing Move-to-Earn Game Walken Announces New Roadmap Goals - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Solana-based Move2earn game Walken has released a new roadmap.

Walken has developed a system that will reward active players more.

The dApp, which has more than 1.11 million users, aims to reach 2 million users by the 4th quarter of 2022.

Walken is a move-to-earn game that counts the steps of users with the motion detection features of wearable devices and smartphones. Walken users are rewarded with WLKN tokens and NFTs based on their step count and in-game economy. With a fast-growing ecosystem, Walken is preparing to take a new step to grow its community and continue to develop its ecosystem. Users of Walken, a platform that gamifies a healthier lifestyle with the help of blockchain technology, will likely appreciate the new features.

Combining sustainability, entertainment, and economy has allowed Walken to have a budding ecosystem. The growing number of attendees and likes globally indicates that people are willing to unlock the benefits that come with Web3. Walken is getting closer and closer to his vision of combining a healthy lifestyle with crypto and gamification. Gamification incentivizes people to become more physically active and lead a sustainable lifestyle with crypto rewards.

New Roadmap

Walken's continued growth has prompted the team to work on a new and more advanced roadmap. A few important developments stand out in the new roadmap that has emerged and presented to users:

The Walken Ambassador program will support local communities.

A new game with CAthlets is under development, will be released in the future.

New languages ​​and better localization support will be added to the application.

The 60 million tokens created by the community will be used to reinvest in Walken and add value to the community.

Ranking systems will be added to the game to show player activity and achievements, and a Wheel of Fortune (on both Android and iOS) to reward active players.

A special referral program will be added to the associated bonuses.

All stages in the roadmap will allow Walken to continue to grow his ecosystem at the same pace it has so far, potentially even faster. The most important element of the ecosystem is to have a large and strong community as it reflects the core values ​​of Web3 technology.

In-Game Economy Statistics

Walken recently shared a few in-game stats that prove the continued expansion of the player base and ecosystem. Considering these statistics, the success of Walken in a short time can be better understood.

Russia is Walken's largest user base (19.6%), followed by Ukraine (10.4%), India (7.34%), and Vietnam (5.13%).

Although the growth of iOS was quite rapid at first, Android reversed this race in August. Currently, the Android app is actively used by more than 7,000 unique users daily, while on iOS, this number is more than 1,000.

Walken peaked in July and August 2022 with over 20,000 new daily users.

Walken has more than 1.11 million users to date. With the new roadmap and move-to-earn concept being the next trend in the crypto world, this number is expected to increase to 2 million by the 4th quarter of 2022.

Quote from the Manager

Commenting on the growth, Walken Co-Founder and CEO Alexei Kulevets adds: “One of the main challenges of any gamified Web3 project is to make it both fun and sustainable, especially the free2play project. With Walken, we are proving that it is possible. We are grateful to our amazing community and work hard to make Walken even better"".

2022-10-25,SeaCoast Will Host $COAST Token Sale on October 25th - Cryptonews,"SeaCoast Will Host $COAST Token Sale on October 25th

Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.

Madrid, Spain, 25th October, 2022, Chainwire

SeaCoast, the maritime startup using web3 technology to pioneer new ways of exploring the world’s waterways, has announced its public token sale. The event will commence on October 25, giving members of the public their first opportunity to purchase $COAST tokens.

The $COAST token will sit at the heart of the nautical ecosystem SeaCoast is developing, centered around curated data of waterways and inlets. This will enable explorers to access rich and up-to-date information that enhances their interactions with local touchpoints.

SeaCoast has developed a trio of applications to support this goal in the form of ShoreView, PortView, and PaperBoat. Together, the apps unlock new ways of interacting with coastal resources while rewarding human curators for the knowledge they share.

ShoreView is a virtual assistant that facilitates coastal navigation through augmented reality and shows the user in real time both what they see and what is invisible to the naked eye. PortView facilitates mooring boats using augmented reality and audio assistance. It is the maritime equivalent to Google Maps’ “how to get there” function since 70% of accidents with rented boats occur at the point of mooring. PaperBoat is a mooring reservation manager that serves as the Booking.com of sailing.

""We do not think of tokens as a possibility to capture resources, but as a way from which we can promote some services and boost the recurrence of users on the platform,"" says Jose Manuel Arnaiz, CEO of the company and founder of Jazztel, DigiMobil and a dozen of other companies.

As a matter of fact, the $COAST token rewards users who share the information they acquire when navigating or discovering places along the coast. Tokens are earned by sharing geo-referenced elements that can then appear on augmented reality maps for other users. The more information about coastal areas that is shared on the platform, the more users will earn as tokens and will level up to obtain various rewards. These can range from priority access to marinas or buoys to discounts at local venues and invitations to events.

About SeaCoast

SeaCoast is harnessing web3 technologies, including tokenization and blockchain, to revolutionize the way people interact with the world’s coastlines. From sailors to ramblers, anyone who interacts with the world’s waterways, including canals, coastlines, and harbors, can contribute to SeaCoast’s trifecta of apps and earn rewards for the valuable data they supply. The $COAST token aligns incentives between participants and accelerates the augmented reality future that SeaCoast is building.

What is Sweat Coin (SWEAT)? What is Sweat Coin (SWEAT)?

Sweatcoin is a free smartphone app that monitors and rewards users for their physical activities.

By integrating the user’s default fitness app; such as Google Fit and Apple Fit, the software will accurately records step taken while working out; either on a treadmill, walking, or jogging. Users also get rewarded with SWEAT, the platform’s digital currency, which can be used to purchase products or easily donated to charity.

Sweatcoin is available on major mobile software, including iOS, Android, and Windows.

The Project

The Sweatcoin app was released in 2016. It was founded by the trio of London-based tech entrepreneur Oleg Fomenko, venture capital worker Anton Derlyatka, and developer Egor Khmelev.

The app aims to encourage better living by paying users for regular physical activity and has more than 100 million users. The Sweatcoin app is the most downloaded health and fitness app in 58 countries

Sweatcoin’s brand-new web3 product is called Sweat Economy. It consists of a cryptocurrency token called SWEAT and a crypto wallet called Sweat Wallet. More than 13 million wallets were created within four months of its introduction.

The original Sweatcoin was not a cryptocurrency, so users were rewarded with vouchers and gift cards after completing a predetermined number of steps. These could then be exchanged for rewards from businesses like Audible and Headspace or contributed to several charitable organisations.

However, the developers wanted a coin that users could spend and exchange for fiat currencies, leading to the launch of the SWEAT native token and Sweat wallet. The Sweat Foundation will also match every Sweatcoin in its balance with an equal amount of Sweat token.

Then, SWEAT owners can choose whether to exchange their tokens for fiat money or alternatively keep the tokens in their balance to earn a staking incentive. Sweatcoin’s ecosystem will eventually incorporate NFTs and DeFi as well in the future.

The Sweatcoin currency, often referred to as sweat economy or by its ticker symbol SWEAT, is built on the Ethereum (ETH) and Near Protocol (NEAR) blockchains and is intended to compensate users who register for the system and engage in physical activity.

Sweatcoin has acquired $13 million in investor funding and intends to hold a stronghold offering on the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) Maker launchpad in addition to a public token sale.

Collaborations

Sweatcoins have value because of their extensive partnerships. Over 600 partners, including insurance companies that want to promote healthier lifestyle choices, businesses that want to appeal to health-conscious consumers, and governments that want to lower healthcare expenses, have collaborated on the project.

For example, Sweatcoin collaborates with the National Health Service (NHS) to deliver healthy incentive programmes all around the nation, using individualised, data-driven strategies to bring about long-lasting behaviour change.

Real Money Value

Users may be able to purchase different goods or services using Sweatcoin depending on their location. The Sweatcoin marketplace offers thousands of amazing branded products and services, such as high-tech shoes, iPhones, anti-gravity yoga sessions, Apple Watches, and more. Users can get discounts on online educational courses or fitness memberships if they want price slashes.

Donation

Sweatcoin for Good (S4G) serves as the project’s charitable initiative. S4G has collaborated with over 100 charity organisations worldwide. With this initiative, users can donate to various environmental, humanitarian, and animal preservation causes.

How Does The Sweatcoin Work?

With a few steps, users can become healthier and join the ‘move-to-earn’ project on Sweatcoin — simply walk and earn.

Sweatcoin crypto’s litepaper states that the token is founded on the concept of “the open economy of movement.” It was launched on the open market in September 2022

People receive a small portion of a Sweatcoin for each step they take. It takes a thousand steps to earn one Sweatcoin. However, users can make ten Sweatcoins or more each day and a few hundred Sweatcoins each month if they exercise frequently.

The free version of the software allows users to earn up to 5 Sweatcoin per day, while the premium version allows users to earn more. Users’ daily limit can be boosted by paying more Sweatcoin according to the level they want.

The app allows users to purchase goods and services thanks to a marketplace feature that includes an auction area. Users can also donate their Sweatcoin to one of the various charities in partnership with the project.

There are “movement validators” who verify that users are performing the necessary number of steps before the Sweatcoin cryptocurrency reward is issued. The validator processes the raw data from the recording device using an algorithm to identify fraudulent activity and guarantee that only genuine movement is rewarded.

While the app currently comes with a standalone crypto wallet, called the Sweat Wallet, it also aims to integrate NFTs and the capability to purchase SWEAT directly with fiat currency in the future. Furthermore, the token will be made available on decentralised exchanges (DEXs) between 2023 and 2024, and a DAO will be given ownership of the cryptocurrency.

The token will also be used to obtain NFTs, subscribe to Sweatcoin’s premium services, and serve as a medium of exchange. Also, the platform intends to broaden the scope of minting the Sweatcoin cryptocurrency beyond walking in 2025 to include cycling and swimming.

Is SWEAT Crypto a Good Investment?

Sweatcoin is a project that rewards people for exercising. Users are more successful and contribute to healthcare cost savings of billions of dollars.

Moreover, health enthusiasts can use the platform to earn passive income while carrying out their usual day-to-day activities.

Some benefits of investing in Sweat crypto include:

Move to Earn

Many people have to walk for extended periods as part of their daily routine. Thankfully, they now have the opportunity to turn all that physical activity into something enjoyable and productive with the advent of “Move to Earn”.

The user’s activity level will determine how much income they can make using Sweatcoin. At the moment, users can earn one Sweatcoin for 1,000 completed steps. Therefore, users will earn 9.5 sweatcoins if they walk 10,000 steps each day minus the 5% commission which the business takes.

At the moment, 1 SWEAT on Coinmarketcap is worth $0.05, implying that one can earn about $0.49 for every 10,000 steps taken. The health benefits of walking those steps and the cash reward makes exercising a worthwhile activity.

A Healthier Lifestyle

The software encourages physical exercise in order to build a healthier and more active world. Therefore, Sweatcoins’ move-to-earn (M2E) style project, which is comparable to a play-to-earn game, allows users to receive rewards in the form of crypto for their involvement. Users can earn cryptocurrency in an M2E game by being physically active in their daily lives.

The team claims that by partnering with the NHS to promote a healthy society and lessen the burden on the world’s healthcare systems, their software has boosted users’ physical activity levels by an average of 20%.

User’s Autonomy

Sweatcoin ensures that keeping users data secure is their top priority. However, they believe everyone should be able to claim ownership of the data they produce, increasing their incentive for exercising or moving. Therefore, the Sweat Foundation is set to develop a platform allowing SWEAT users to select how to make a profit from their data.

The Sweat DAO will grant users control of their data and allow them the option to earn money from it. Any organisation, investor, healthcare provider, or insurer can purchase a person’s SWEAT to obtain data for analysis.

A SWEAT holder could, for instance, decide to work with a health insurer through this platform, who will pay for access to their activity data. The holders could also add their information to a pool of aggregate data, resulting in functions like global activity indices. Therefore, as its inventor and owner, the user would be compensated for selling this data to insurers, physicians, academic institutions, and investors. The DAO would be paid to provide the service.

Partnership

The developers set a lofty objective for themselves. Sweatcoin should evolve into a wellness movement that will help enhance many public spheres, not just another move-to-earn effort.

Due to this vision and initiative, many reputable companies across the world have joined Sweatcoin as partners. The current significant partners of Sweatcoin include Spartan, Electric Capital, Sandeep Nailwal, Do Kwon, and others.

Sweatcoin has teamed up with the National Health Service (NHS) to deliver healthy incentive programmes all around the country, utilising individualised data-driven strategies to bring about long-lasting behaviour change.

Additionally, Sweatcoin introduced the charitable programme “Sweatcoin for Good” (S4G). S4G currently collaborates with more than 100 non-profits that are experts in a variety of sectors. Famous names like Save The Children, the African Wildlife Foundation, the NAACP, and others are on the list of supported charities.

Staking Rewards

Crypto staking is the process of temporarily “locking up” a portion of your cryptocurrency to support a blockchain network. Another option for users to interact and profit on the site is through staking Sweat tokens. Better benefits and improved app experiences are available to users who stake higher, including lower transaction fees, premium services, and increased daily SWEAT minting limitations.

2022-08-30,"No Secret Pact to Sue AVAX Rivals, Lawyer Lied to Impress: CEO - Blockworks","key takeaways A controversial report ruffled feathers by claiming lawyer Kyle Roche and Ava Labs formed a secret pact to damage rivals

“All videos passed our analysis as real videos,” a digital media forensics expert told Blockworks

Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer is hitting back at claims of engaging in a secret pact to harm AVAX competitors with lawyer Kyle Roche.

Website CryptoLeaks published a series of videos last week in which Roche revealed he was granted 1% of the supply of avalanche (AVAX) tokens and similar size in equity in exchange for filing lawsuits against crypto companies.

CryptoLeaks claimed that Ava and law firm Roche Freedman wanted to use the American legal system “gangster style” to chase rival crypto firms, which would subsequently turn regulatory attention onto them.

Reacting in a blog post on Monday, Sirer suggested Roche’s statements in the videos were untruthful and designed to dazzle a potential client.

“These claims evidently came about when Roche, a lawyer at a firm we retained in the early days of our company, tried to impress a potential business partner by making false claims about the nature of his work for Ava Labs,” Sirer wrote.

CoinGecko lists AVAX’s total supply at 409,165,637, which means 1% would equate to nearly 4.1 million AVAX ($83.6 million). Ava Labs’ valuation is unknown at this time.

Apart from Roche’s statements, allegations made by CryptoLeaks are “categorically false,” he added. AVAX fell 26% after publication of the ‘secret pact’ report. The token is down 81% so far this year at $20.23, the Blockworks Research portal shows.

“Neither I, nor anyone else at Ava Labs ever directed Roche in his selection of cases. We do not receive materials or information from him, and we do not entrust our legal affairs to him,” Sirer wrote, adding that Roche has represented Ava Labs only in a defensive capacity in ordinary disputes.

The alleged pact didn’t specify that Roche would bring lawsuits against other parties on behalf of Ava Labs itself.

Legitimate videos in AVAX ‘secret pact’ report

Roche Freedman has sued a string of crypto companies including Solana, Binance, Bibox, BitMEX and KuCoin over allegations of offering crypto assets which were unregistered securities.

The firm also represented Ira Kleiman in his lawsuit against Craig Wright, having recently secured a $100 million judgement for Kleiman.

Earlier this year, Roche Freedman was on the other side of the table after former partner Paul Fattaruso sued the firm for denying compensation and equity interest.

Fattaruso reportedly claimed Roche Freedman removed him from a partnership and deprived him of a 2% share in a $250 million crypto fee the firm received for legal services provided to an unnamed startup.

Some pundits have questioned the integrity of CryptoLeaks’ allegations and questioned whether it’s funded by an Avalanche competitor, alluding to its two previous reports which leaned towards Internet Computer (ICP).

Dfinity — the company behind Internet Computer blockchain — was slapped with a class–action lawsuit by Roche last year.

In his own response on Monday, Kyle Roche claimed the CryptoLeaks article contained “numerous unsourced false statements and illegally obtained, highly edited video clips.”

Loading Tweet.. The claims have captured the attention of popular crypto investor Cobie.

Roche identified an unknown speaker in the videos as Christen Ager-Hanssen, whom Roche said works for ICP’s creator Dominic Williams.

Separately, digital media forensics expert Siwei Lyu confirmed that the videos included in the report were legitimate and didn’t show traces of deepfake synthesis.

The evidence was corroborated by hand positions and the presence of objects such as glasses. “All videos passed our analysis as real videos,” Lyu told Blockworks.

Kyle Roche and ICP creator Dominic Williams didn’t return Blockworks’ request for comment by press time.

2022-10-21,Can I Mine Solana? Solana Nodes and SOL Staking Explained - CoinCodex,"Solana is one of the most popular blockchain platforms in the world today. Thanks to its blazing fast speed and low transaction fees, a growing number of users is choosing Solana to participate in decentralized finance, trade NFTs and earn tokens in games and mobile apps.

In this article, we’ll be providing you with a quick overview of how Solana staking works and address some of the most common questions users have about this network.

Can I mine Solana?

Some users are wondering whether Solana can be mined. The short answer is no—Solana doesn’t use a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, so there is technically no way to mine Solana.

Running a Solana node vs. delegating SOL

Solana uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, which means that the network provides rewards to users that are staking their SOL to help secure the network. The consensus process of the Solana network is handled by validators, which process transactions and add new blocks to the Solana blockchain. Solana is a permissionless network, which means that anyone is free to deploy a validator so long as they meet the technical requirements.

Users can participate in the Solana blockchain’s consensus process either by running a validator node themselves, or delegating their SOL stake to a validator to earn a portion of the staking rewards earned by it.

Most users are not running their own Solana node—data from Solana Beach shows that at the time of writing, there’s just under 2,100 active validator nodes on the Solana network. For most people, delegation will be the more realistic option than running a node. This is because running a Solana node has a substantial barrier to entry in terms of the required computer hardware.

Running a Solana validator node requires a CPU with at least 12 cores and 48 threads, at least 128 GB of RAM, as well as relatively large amounts of storage. If you want to run an RPC node, the requirements are even higher—you need at least 256 GB of RAM, for example. You can view the full list of requirements in the official Solana documentation.

Most people cannot justify purchasing and maintaining such a system. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t help secure the Solana network if you are just a regular SOL holder.

If you want to contribute to the network and earn some SOL coins in returns, the best option for you would be to delegate your stake to a validator. The validator will participate in the consensus process on the behalf of you and all other users that have delegated SOL to them, and distribute the staking rewards back to delegators.

Stake SOL to earn rewards

If you have some SOL and want to earn rewards on your holdings without operating a validator node, you can stake your SOL tokens by delegating them to a validator. You can do so through a cryptocurrency wallet that support Solana staking, or through a centralized cryptocurrency exchange like Binance. The main advantage of staking SOL through your wallet is that you can choose to delegate your SOL to any validator you want. The biggest advantage of staking SOL through exchanges is convenience.

Using a wallet to stake SOL

There are a number of Solana wallets that will allow you to stake your SOL coins and earn rewards. Some examples of wallets that support staking include:

Phantom

Solflare

Glow

Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X

Atomic Wallet

As we’ve already mentioned, staking through a wallet gives you the ability to select which validator you want to delegate to. There’s of course also the benefit that you stay in control of your private keys.

Staking SOL on exchanges

If you’re comfortable with entrusting your SOL to a cryptocurrency exchange, this way of staking is extremely convenient. All you have to do is choose how much SOL you want to stake, and the exchange will do the rest of the work for you. However, the downside is that you won’t necessarily have the freedom to choose which validators you want to delegate your SOL coins to.

Some examples of exchanges that support Solana staking include:

Binance

Kraken

Coinbase

Gemini

Uphold

What determines Solana staking rewards?

When you stake Solana coins, it’s impossible to know exactly how much you will receive in rewards. This is because the Solana validator profitability depends on multiple factors.

The main factor that determines the annual yield earned from staking SOL is the percentage of the total Solana supply that is staked. The larger this percentage is, the lower the yield is. The rewards earned by a validator are also determined by their uptime—more reliable validators earn more SOL.

For delegators, the amount of SOL rewards will be influenced by the commission charged by the validator you’re delegating to. There is also the risk of “slashing”, which could result in losses for delegators. To a large extent, you can avoid the risk of slashing by delegating your SOL to a reputable validator with a long track record.

The bottom line—SOL staking and Solana nodes

While it’s not possible to mine Solana, users can still participate in the network by running a Solana node or delegating their SOL to a validator. This process is called staking, and allows you to earn SOL rewards passively. The yield you will earn are difficult to estimate accurately, as they will depend on network conditions and the reliability of the validator you select. You can choose to stake SOL through your own wallet or use Solana staking services offered by cryptocurrency exchanges.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNDI5L2Nhbi1pLW1pbmUtc29sYW5hLXNvbGFuYS1ub2Rlcy1hbmQtc29sLXN0YWtpbmctZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBYGh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNDI5L2Nhbi1pLW1pbmUtc29sYW5hLXNvbGFuYS1ub2Rlcy1hbmQtc29sLXN0YWtpbmctZXhwbGFpbmVkLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-10-14,The most awaited NFT card game of 2022 is now on Presale - Cryptonews,"The most awaited NFT card game of 2022 is now on Presale

NFT card games seem to be a dime a dozen these days and there are a few that truly stand out. It’s easy to see why these types of games are a hit, as they are easy to pick up and play. They don’t tend to have too many complicated mechanics and the collectible nature adds a nice touch to the game.

In the sea of NFT card games, there are only a few that are truly successful - but there is a new kid on the block that is showing existing games that there is a lot more room for innovation in the niche. Calvaria , a game with a unique narrative and setting, is causing a stir in the NFT games space with its innovative features and accessibility.

Calvaria’s Presale is Pulling Investors In

It’s rare to see an NFT card game attract so much attention when there are a good number of them already in the market. But Calvaria’s unique features and captivating design have caught the attention of its investors, which has led to heavy activity in the presale.

Calvaria is currently in the first stage of its presale.

Calvaria’s presale , which is live right now, is offering its RIA tokens at a price of $0.01 per token. That amounts to 1 USDT netting the investor 100 RIA tokens. The first presale is selling 30 million RIA tokens, with a total of 300 million RIA tokens available across all presales. The price range of the RIA token across the presales will vary from $0.01 to $0.325.

A quick look at the Calvaria website shows you why the NFT card game is so popular. The project has plenty of features lined up, striking artwork for each of its factions, and a roadmap that shows that the team has plenty more lined up for the future.

But perhaps the most compelling feature of the crypto card game is the fact that it has both Play-to-Earn and Free-to-Play modes, which makes it attractive to crypto and non-crypto users alike. The team prides itself on making the game accessible and users don’t even need to hold or purchase any assets to start playing the game. The game is also available on both desktop and mobile devices.

Of course, there are differences between the P2E and F2P versions, but both offer players rewards for their in-game activities. The team’s vision is to create a fun and accessible game, and to that end, it seems to be succeeding on many fronts. For example, unlike other NFT card games, Calvaria will also feature a story mode and the ability to play without a crypto wallet. You can learn more in the Calvaria whitepaper .

The project has several features, including staking, a DAO, and a scholarship system.

The game will include such features as staking, a scholarship system, mini-games, and an in-game store. The Calvaria team wants the project to be run by the community and as such there will be a DAO that will govern the future of the project.

If crypto game enthusiasts want to get in on the Calvaria presale , they should consider entering now at the current presale stage 1. The RIA token price will only increase in future presales and the tokens are quickly being snapped up by investors.

2022-09-20,Cryptocurrency Investment Platform HASHFROG Partnered With BITMAIN and ANTPOOL To Enter The KDA Ecosystem - CoinCodex,"Singapore-2022/13/09, In recent years, the cryptocurrency market has been especially prosperous with a series of cryptocurrency projects emerged, bringing rich investment opportunities and market risks to participants in the blockchain industry. KDA is also one of the emerging cryptocurrency projects, but unlike others, KDA is referred to as the next cryptocurrency project that can be benchmarked with BTC because of its simplicity and transaction cost-efficiency, better scalability than BTC, and the future circulation potential of 990 million tokens. With the joining of BITMAIN, the world's largest miner manufacturer, KDA may become a new opportunity for cryptocurrency investors.

HASHFROG, a diversified cryptocurrency investment platform, announced that it has reached a strategic cooperation with BITMAIN and ANTPOOL, and will jointly launch KDA cloud mining products to provide low-cost, flexible and efficient mining services for KDA participants around the world. On September 13, 2022, the three parties jointly held an online product launch and elaborated on the cooperation relationship as well as their expectations for the future of the KDA market.

Xmei Lin, the marketing director of BITMAIN, also announced at the press conference that BITMAIN would gift three KA3 miners to Kadena's development team to support the technical research of the development team. As a firm believer in the POW consensus mechanism, BITMAIN will continue to contribute to the POW ecology in the future and actively support the long-term development and ecological prosperity of outstanding POW projects such as Kadena.

ANTPOOL, the world's leading mining pool, sits at the crucial part of the mining industry chain providing pool services for a variety of cryptocurrencies. In this cooperation, ANTPOOL can provide HASHFROG with sufficient KDA mining pool resources and endorsement of security. So far ANTPOOL is the only mining pool that specialized in optimizing KDA's hashrate which allows KDA's high hashrate miner to give full play to its performance in the shortest possible time, technically guaranteeing the long-term stable operation of KDA miner, aiming at maximizing the mining revenue of customers. ANTPOOL has become the strongest guarantee for KDA's high-quality output by its advanced algorithm, simplicity, transparency, and efficiency of operation while reducing energy consumption at the same time.

As the platform providing KDA mining products in this cooperation, HASHFROG will divide the hashrate of KA3 miner exclusively supplied by BITMAIN into a minimum order size of 10t. Customers can flexibly choose the mining unit to purchase based on their own needs. Multiple mining cycle options such as 90 days, 120 days and 180 days are provided to improve the investment flexibility greatly. Management team from HASHFROG announced at the press conference that the platform will provide $1000000 worth of bonus benefits to users who purchase KDA mining products in this initial launch, and encourage users to actively engage in cloud mining. This large amount of welfare will further expand the return on mining output. HASHFROG, positioned as a diversified crypto service provider, will also launch mining services for a variety of cryptocurrencies in the future, with more crypto product launches planned on the platform around the end of October this year to provide investors with various asset allocation options.

HASHFROG is committed to build a safe and compliant blockchain infrastructure and produce innovative and diversified digital currency investment products. It is a one-stop platform that provides cloud mining service, extensive crypto-financial management, and flexible digital asset allocation solutions for global digital currency lovers. This strategic cooperation with BITMAIN and ANTPOOL on KDA marks that the three parties will deeply integrate miner, site and mining pool resources and continue to deepen and enrich ecological cooperation in mining as well as energy industry by increasing upstream and downstream value along the industry, and providing a solid guarantee for long-term investment of cryptocurrencies.

2022-10-08,Stand A Good Chance Of Becoming A Crypto Millionaire With These Tokens— Filecoin and Big Eyes Coin - CoinCodex,"Like other financial markets, the cryptocurrency market experiences market cycles. This makes it necessary for crypto investors to have a clear plan and investing strategy that will enable them to navigate each market cycle. One strategy is to look for new and low-priced cryptocurrency projects that would recover when the market cycle shifts, making it possible for you to get the most out of your investments. To uncover these opportunities, you must invest a lot of time in project scouting and research. This article will look into every facet of the best cryptocurrency projects to consider supporting. Filecoin (FIL) and newcomer Big Eyes Coin (BIG) can help you navigate the prolonged crypto winter and make you a millionaire.

Filecoin (FIL) - The File-Sharing Network

Juan Benet and his colleagues at Protocol Labs created the cryptocurrency and decentralized file-sharing network known as Filecoin (FIL). Filecoin (FIL) uses blockchain technology to provide consumers with several advantages. Filecoin (FIL) is a cryptocurrency that attempts to take advantage of the growing desire for decentralized file-sharing networks by fusing a number of technologies to provide users with exclusive benefits in exchange for FIL.

Filecoin (FIL) addresses various difficulties afflicting the current cloud storage sector because of the industry's centralized structure. Due to the centralization of the platform, the global network of computer operators on the Filecoin (FIL) platform is encouraged to promote user-to-user file-sharing and storage, encourage increased user collaboration, and utilize proper filtering. These benefits have led to quick growth in the Filecoin (FIL) community. The FIL token, the network's native token, is used on the Filecoin network. FIL tokens are flexible digital assets that can be traded on exchanges worldwide. They are also accepted as payment.

What is Big Eyes Coin (BIG)?

The crypto market was once dominated by many dog-themed projects and DeFi meme currencies. These meme coins parody one another while employing different dog breeds as glaring emblems. Some have made exemplary accomplishments, but Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has taken everyone by surprise, especially with its success of raising over 3.5 million in its presale stages. The project chose a lovely big-eyed cat as its emblem. This is the project's first significant alteration to be made. BIG will be the governance token for Big Eyes Coin, which will run on the Ethereum Blockchain. To improve and do better than dog-themed tokens, the Big Eyes Coin initiative will imitate the endearing qualities of a regular cat, such as cuteness, perseverance, friendliness, and diligence.

The Big Eyes Coin's primary goal is protecting marine life, but it also stands out for its novel marketing approach, which includes charitable donations. A strong community, which has always been the cornerstone of every meme coin, may be built by the project's fans with a sense of togetherness and solidarity. If you want to diversify your portfolio, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) should be on your radar before it's too late.

2022-09-12,Bybit Launches ‘Expand Your Options’ Educational Series to Help Traders Navigate Crypto Options Landscape - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Bybit has launched an educational series, called “Expand Your Options”, dedicated to both rookie and veteran options traders

The series, mentored by Bybit’s team of crypto analysts, covers a wide range of basic and advanced options trading topics

The launch of the new guide follows the roll-out of Bybit's new Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana options contracts

The guide launches after the rollout of new BTC, ETH, and SOL options contracts

Bybit, one of the leading digital asset trading platforms, has announced the launch of the “Expand Your Options” educational series. The crypto options trading guide, put together by Bybit’s veteran analysts, is commemorating the launch of new Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana options contracts on the platform.

Bybit’s latest educational offering is aimed at newcomers and experienced traders alike, featuring a range of basic topics as well as high-level content tailored for veterans wanting to hone their trading skills.

The guide, focused on Bybit’s USDC-margined options contracts, consists of eight parts, covering options basics as well as advanced hedging strategies. Case in point, the third and fourth parts of the newly-launched guide include sections dedicated to “covered call”, “straddle”, and “strangle” options investment approaches. In addition, the series includes a step-by-step walk-through and a detailed explanation of options spreads.

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou commented on the new guide’s launch in a statement:

“The new options guide will help empower our users to achieve their financial dreams. Our team of experts has created this ultimate guide to trading options, which covers everything from beginner to advanced strategies. We are now a crypto ‘super app’ that serves all crypto participants; anything our customers need in crypto, we will offer.”

Bybit expanded its suite of crypto investment products and services with the launch of crypto USDC-margined and settled options earlier this year. They are European-style cash-settled products, meaning they can only be exercised upon the contract’s expiration date.

In June, the exchange rolled out a portfolio margin mode, enabling derivatives traders to have their risk calculated across the entire portfolio. The feature essentially increases the overall capital efficiency since winning positions can be used to offset losses acquired by losing positions.

Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction: October 2022

With the updates incoming for SHIB this October, the price of the coin will likely see an increase at the beginning of October, promoting a rally.

Our end of 2022 prediction states that the maximum value of SHIB can reach $0.00001448. If the hype continues for Shiba Inu this month, the current $0.00001121 value may creep up over the $0.000013 mark. That was the coin’s high in September. It’s hard to predict if it can reach the high of $0.000017 that SHIB hit in the summer, however, it is also possible.

A safe prediction for Shiba Inu in the month of October is the coin reaching around $0.0000135. The coin shouldn’t go much below its current value throughout the month. On the other hand, hype in the SHIBarmy can make the ceiling endless for Shiba Inu in October.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3Mvc2hpYmEtaW51LXByaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb24tb2N0b2Jlci0yMDIy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-08,Big Eyes Coin - The Upcoming Meme Coin Coming For ... - Tekedia,"In the midst of the harsh realities of the bear market, one crypto project has become the source of hope and excitement for all within the cryptocurrency industry. Big Eyes Coin (BIG), the industry’s latest meme coin, is using cuteness to win over major players in the crypto space.

With an ample supply and an exciting road map, this upcoming meme coin has managed to amass a large following of enthusiasts who believe the coin has what it takes to become an industry beater in the not-too-distant future.

Big Eyes Coin (BIG) provides utility and other functions to the Big Eyes project and is essential to its operation and ecosystem. There seems to be a high amount of expectation from the token, which is already in its presale stage.

The belief in Big Eyes Coin’s success is so high that it is already garnering comparisons to industry leaders such as Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC). Some within the industry even believe the token has the potential to surpass these two altcoins.

To that effect, this piece examines what the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is all about, what to expect and how it compares to Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC).

Avalanche (AVAX) – Can This Speed Continue As Users Rise?

Avalanche (AVAX) is a notable blockchain network that functions as an ideal environment for Decentralized Applications (dApps) and custom blockchain networks. Avalanche (AVAX) can achieve a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second (tps) without compromising scalability. This level of speed and performance puts Avalanche (AVAX) among a select group of blockchain networks with the capacity to challenge Ethereum (ETH).

Avalanche (AVAX) consists of three built-in blockchains which serve distinct purposes. The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) enables sending and receiving funds on the Avalanche network. Others include the Performance Chain (P-Chain) and Contract Chain (C-Chain).

AVAX, its native cryptocurrency, plays an integral role in its operations, facilitating several functions such as transactions, network governance and staking. AVAX is available on several crypto platforms, including Binance, Bitfinex, Gate.io and Kucoin.

Polygon (MATIC) – Making Ethereum An Affordable Blockchain

Polygon (MATIC) is the cryptocurrency industry’s first well-structured, easy-to-use Ethereum (ETH) scaling and infrastructure development platform. Polygon (MATIC) effectively transforms Ethereum (ETH) into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains) similar to other ones such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM).

Like many other blockchain-based platforms, Polygon (MATIC) seeks to stimulate the mass adoption of crypto by resolving the many problems within the industry, such as scalability.

Its native cryptocurrency, MATIC, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. MATIC facilitates payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem.

As a top 20 cryptocurrency by market cap, MATIC is available on several top crypto platforms within the industry, such as Binance, Coinbase Pro, Huobi Global, FTX and Kucoin.

Big Eyes Coin (BIG) – The Memes Cannot Be Stopped

2022-10-07,BNB Chain's $566M Hack: Binance Network's Major Bridge Attack ... - Crypto Briefing,"Key Takeaways BNB Chain suffered a $566 million exploit Thursday after a hacker tricked the BSC Token Hub bridge into sending them two million BNB.

The hacker took a novel approach to siphon the funds across other networks, making off with about $110 million.

The BNB Chain halted the network and is weighing an asset freeze, highlighting major centralization issues.

Share this article URL Copied

The BNB Chain team temporarily halted the network in response to the attack, which speaks volumes about the network’s centralization issues.

BNB Chain Targeted

Last night’s nine-figure hack on BNB Chain’s bridge has caused a major commotion in the cryptocurrency community.

An attacker targeted the Binance-run blockchain network late Thursday, successfully making off with around $110 million worth of crypto. But while $110 million is by all accounts a pretty tidy paycheck for a few hours of work, it’s just a fraction of the overall size of the exploit. On-chain data shows that the attacker commenced the elaborate hack by tricking BNB Chain’s BSC Token Hub bridge into sending them two million BNB tokens worth about $566 million. According to Paradigm researcher samczsun, the attacker used a complex multi-step process to exploit a bug in the bridge, effectively forging the bridge’s code so that they could make two separate one million BNB withdrawals. The bridge sent the funds and continued to run as normal until multiple community members raised suspicions over the size of the withdrawals. The BNB Chain responded by halting the blockchain.

Bridge Flaws Exposed

The incident caught the crypto space’s attention partly due to the scale of the exploit. Though the hacker’s takings are currently around $110 million, the two million BNB theft places the incident on a par with other major attacks like the $552 million hack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge in March. Once again, the BNB Chain exploit has sounded the alarm on the security risks of cross-chain bridges. As crypto has evolved and various Layer 1 networks have emerged alongside Ethereum (BNB Chain itself is essentially an Ethereum clone), demand for cross-chain interoperability has soared. That’s created an opportunity for bridges like BNB Chain’s product to cater to the market’s needs. Per Defi Llama data, the total value locked in crypto bridges is over $10 billion today, helped by BNB Chain and other networks soaring in popularity in 2021.

While bridges are useful for connecting blockchains, they’re widely considered less secure than base layer networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum because they often use a central storage point to lock deposited assets. That’s led to a surge in hacks; an August Chainalysis report found that bridge hacks account for 69% of all crypto theft, with the takings topping $2 billion to date.

While bridge hackers usually have different methods for stealing funds, they’re typically able to execute their attacks by exploiting shoddy code. The BNB Chain hack was no different; the attacker found a way to forge a proof so that they could make two fraudulent withdrawals. They quickly funneled the funds to different locations, meaning that a significant portion of the stolen funds was already on the move when the BNB Chain team decided to halt the network.

Tracking the Attacker’s Moves

Perhaps the most curious element of the hack has been the attacker’s activity following the exploit itself. Given the size of the haul, the hacker faced limitations in their options for laundering the funds—simply because bigger pots like this tend to draw more attention from crypto, on-chain investigators, and authorities alike. On-chain data shows that the hacker transferred their funds to multiple locations, but they took a novel approach that differs from most other similar thefts.

As the Treasury Department noted when it banned Tornado Cash in August, hackers frequently turn to crypto mixers to siphon stolen funds. While the hacker could have pulled a similar move to cover their traces, they instead opted to deposit just under half of the takings into Venus Protocol, a lending product on BNB Chain. That may be because they would have struggled to exchange all of their BNB tokens without impacting the price; Tornado Cash takes deposits in ETH, DAI, cDAI, USDC, and USDT, meaning they would have had to trade their assets and move over to Ethereum to use it.

By providing BNB as collateral on Venus, the hacker was able to borrow around $150 million in stablecoins. This is an interesting play because they borrowed USDT, USDC, and BUSD—centralized stablecoins that can be frozen by their issuers. Tether blacklisted at least $6.5 million of the haul, blocking the hacker from cashing out the USDT they borrowed. The hacker used several strategies to deploy their funds on other networks, converting much of the haul into ETH.

Blockchain security firm SlowMist estimates that the hacker moved around $110 million from BNB Chain to six other Ethereum-compatible networks: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, the bulk of the transferred funds have not yet been laundered, and the hacker has left most of the takings on BNB Chain. For such a sophisticated attack, they’ve left a huge sum of money on the table given that the stolen BNB could be frozen.

BNB took a hit following the incident and is down about 3.5% today. Besides BNB, the hacker’s largest position is ETH—they currently have over $32.5 million sitting in this wallet.

BNB Chain Responds

The BNB Chain team responded to the incident as talk of the attack circulated on Crypto Twitter. The blockchain’s official Twitter account confirmed at 22:19 UTC that it had paused the network, noting that it had identified a “potential exploit.” Some applauded the team for the response, with Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao saying that he was “impressed by the quick actions the [team] took.” However, the decision to halt the chain also prompted many to call out the blockchain’s centralized design. “You’re supposed to be immutable fren,” tweeted the Bitcoin DeFi project Stacks. Others posted memes of CZ to imply that he had full oversight of the network’s validators.

Immutability is considered a key feature of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, but controlled network halts expose centralization issues that throw that idea to sea. When a blockchain can be paused, it’s not immutable. The largest blockchain, Bitcoin, has never been halted since it launched in 2009. Bitcoin has over 10,000 full validator nodes worldwide, while Ethereum has just over 8,000. Like BNB Chain, Ethereum operates a Proof-of-Stake mechanism with over 400,000 validators securing the network. BNB Chain, meanwhile, relies on just 44 (of those 44, 26 are currently active). In a statement, the BNB Chain team said that “decentralized chains are not designed to be stopped,” adding that contacting the network’s 26 active validators prevented further damage.

BNB Chain successfully restarted the network after syncing validators early Friday, and the network is now running as normal with the hacker’s wallet blacklisted. Questions remain over what will happen to the BNB and centralized stablecoins on BNB Chain, currently valued at over $426 million (the hacker still has $254 million worth of BNB collateralized against $147 million worth of stablecoins on Venus). Due to the scale of the attack, it’s likely that authorities will soon be involved, too.

BNB Chain’s statement said that it would be down to the community to decide whether to freeze the hacked funds “for the common good of BNB,” and it’s also offering a bounty reward of 10% of the recovered funds for uncovering the hacker. The BNB Chain took responsibility for the incident in its note. “We want to apologize to the community for the exploit that occurred. We own this,” the note read.

2022-10-13,Making Web3 Closer: A Look Inside NEAR Protocol’s Ecosystem with Hundreds of Use Cases for DApps - CoinCodex,"The internet that we know today is gradually evolving towards a fundamentally new concept with decentralized technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies and NFTs ruling the roost. Started as a solution that redefines the nature of money and finance, today blockchain becomes more deeply ingrained in our lives, revolutionizing the way people interact with Web2.

Despite the ongoing pace of Web3 adoption outruns early adoption rates of the internet, there are still some pain points that prevent people from immersing themselves in this idea en masse. In order to successfully onboard millions of users and ensure their experience is hassle-free and seamless, effective solutions are needed that address knowledge gaps and blockchain scalability issues.

This is why the emergence of NEAR Protocol in 2020 has become the talk of the town in the industry, which, though it has a few scalability methods already deployed, still needed a solution with potentially unlimited capacity. Helping developers, entrepreneurs and end-users carve the pave to Web3 that is open-sourced, decentralized, and supposed to be much more secure, the NEAR team aims to attract at least 1 billion users to its platform and make mainstream adoption of a new iteration of the internet a reality.

In this article, we’ll plunge into the NEAR ecosystem and evaluate its impact on the future of Web3.

What Is NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

NEAR Protocol is a smart contract-capable platform designed for developers with various skill levels when it comes to blockchain and crypto. Due to its own consensus mechanism called Doomslug and specially created NEAR SDK, DApps can be created within just 5 minutes and coded with the most familiar languages, such as JavaScript, Rust and Solidity.

Being today’s most scalable blockchain, NEAR Protocol uses sharding technology to process more then 100,000 transactions per second simultaneously without compromising security while maintaining low transaction costs. The project is considered to be a serious competitor to Ethereum and so-called Ethereum killers, including Cardano, Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos, and Avalanche, none of these are even close to having NEAR’s throughput.

The network charges fees in NEAR tokens for storing data and completing transactions within the ecosystem. Currently, there are 781 million coins in circulation which constitutes 79% of a total supply which is 1 billion NEAR tokens created at genesis. The model that underlies NEAR’s tokenomics implies issuing a 5% additional supply of tokens annually to further reward validators, while a portion of network fees in NEAR are burned to maintain scarcity.

Besides, NEAR token holders can stake their assets to participate in securing the network and receive rewards. According to Staking Rewards, the current annualized return from staking on NEAR is 10%.

Aurora

Aurora is a layer-2 solution that allows for creating Ethereum smart contracts in the NEAR network. In fact, this is an advanced Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implemented as a smart contract on NEAR that helps with scaling Ethereum ecosystem for developers who can now expand their DApps without the need to rewrite them or examine Web3 tools as well as benefit from high capacity and low fees.

The solution is composed of the Aurora Engine which ensures full compatibility with Ethereum and the Aurora Bridge which is used to transfer smart contracts. Transactions on Aurora are executed within 2 seconds and cost approximately $0.02.

Aurora supports all tools that are offered by the Ethereum ecosystem, including MetaMask, Truffle, Remix, etc. Transaction fees are paid in ETH which facilitates the adoption and provides a great UX for those developers who got used to Ethereum’s functionality.

Rainbow Bridge

One more scaling solution that connects NEAR and Aurora with Ethereum is the Rainbow Bridge enabling fast, secure and cheap transfers of ERC-20 tokens. Its core protocol is fully compatible with stablecoins, wrapped assets, DEX, lending and service company tokens as well as with NFTs.

As an Aurora’s product that is available to everyone, the Rainbow Bridge does not require any special permission to deploy, maintain or use. You just need to have the Ethereum Faucet and MetaMask Wallet for Ethereum and Aurora. As for NEAR, you can use the official NEAR Wallet or MyNearWallet.

Transfers between NEAR and Aurora happen as a single transaction and are executed within seconds with costs not exceeding a few cents. Transfers from Ethereum are processed in the same way but may take up to 10 minutes. However, sending funds back to Ethereum involves two transactions and may need approximately 16 hours, while its cost depends on gas prices and is always unpredictable.

Octopus Network

The Octopus Network is an interoperable multichain network for launching and running Web3 application-specific blockchains also known as appchains. At the heart of the platform there is the Octopus Relay represented by a set of smart contracts building on NEAR, which was selected as a mainchain of the whole network when NEAR and Octopus Network partnered in 2021.

The Octopus Relay supports interoperability between appchains and NEAR so that they can also become interoperable with blockchains outside the Octopus Network via bridges on NEAR (like Ethereum via the Rainbow Bridge), or with an out-of-box IBC pallet maintaining connection with any IBC-enabled blockchains, including Cosmos and Polkadot.

By operating as a free market where appchains are able to lease the level of security they need in their native tokens at market price from $OCT holders. Absolutely any project can apply to become an appchain, however, they need to complete several steps which are: registration, audit, voting, and booting.

Ecosystem

Along with Aurora and the Octopus Network, NEAR Protocol creates an iron triangle to empower even more decentralized applications with ecosystem sustainability possibilities. Being a relatively young blockchain with so much to offer to the industry, NEAR Protocol has already become home to over 800 projects, thus creating many viable use cases, including but not limited to wallets, DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, metaverses, dev tools, stablecoins, oracles, DAOs, etc.

Now, let’s have a look at the most prominent projects that form the NEAR ecosystem.

Attarius Network

Attarius Network is the first ever one-stop-shop NFT ecosystem for the gaming industry which aims at facilitating the creation, integration and management of Web3 games and game assets. The team is working on a developer toolkit to add value to various gaming projects and bring new economic features for making money to gamers and supporters. Attarius Network partnered with the Octopus Network to become an appchain candidate as well as brought GameFi to Aurora by integrating in-house GameAPI to it.

Aurigami

As Aurora’s native decentralized non-custodial money market, Aurigami allows for turning Aurora-based assets into interest-bearing auTokens so that they can be utilized more efficiently and strategically. At the same time, the platform enables leveraging through collateralized borrowing with an opportunity to deploy borrowed funds elsewhere for getting additional yield. Thus, by unlocking some extra liquidity and flexibility of assets, Aurigami contributes significantly to the DeFi prosperity.

Flux

Flux Protocol represents the trustless data layer for Web3. Operating as the cross-chain, open-source and permissionless oracle, it provides smart contracts with access to economically secure data feeds and lets developers design solutions for data provision and retrieval, for example, create markets based on assets, commodities, or real-world events. Shortly after Flux was rolled out on NEAR, it partnered with Aurora to help bootstrap the ecosystem’s growth of DeFi.

Math Wallet

Being the world’s first insured multi-chain and multi-platform (available for desktop, Android and iOS) wallet designed for Web3, Math Wallet supports cross-chain token bridges and multi-chain dApp store as well as sending, storage and exchange of over 140 popular assets: NEAR, AURORA, all BTC, ETH/ERC20, NEO/NEP5, EOS, TRON, ONT/ONG, ENU/Telos/EOSC/BOS, Binance Chain, and Cosmos/IRIS tokens.

MyNearWallet

MyNearWallet is an open-source, non-custodial web-based wallet with full transparency for the whole NEAR community. Taking over the original NEAR Wallet codebase, it provides users with a better and more secure way to store, buy, send, and stake NEAR assets. In addition, it supports wNEAR (a wrapped version of NEAR token deployed on Aurora which makes it compatible with non-native blockchains like Ethereum) swaps, as well as decentralized apps and non-fungible tokens.

Muse Network

With blockchain and NFTs increasingly integrating to the music industry, credible and low-cost copyright solutions are required. Muse Network is a high-performance music public chain actively building out on Octopus Network that enables all participants to work together on creation, discovery and sharing of music. Copyright authentication process is significantly simplified by the process of generating unique, permanent and non-tamperable data on blockchain through hashing and time stamping. Community incentivized rewards that can be received through sharing, tipping and engagement of content make it possible for artists to spread and trade their music pieces.

NEAR Explorer and NEAR Wallet

These are two in-house solutions designed by the NEAR Protocol team. NEAR Explorer serves as an online blockchain browser which displays the contents of individual NEAR blocks and transactions as well as the transaction histories and balances of addresses. NEAR Wallet is an in-browser web-based wallet for operating with NEAR accounts, which stores account keys in open text using the localStorage on the user's machine.

NearPay

NearPay is a crypto finance protocol that facilitates user experience with managing, spending and exchanging cryptocurrencies. NearPay’s suite of products includes NearPay Wallet and NearPay Card, which provide convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solutions. Additionally, NearPay provides a widget that allows users to buy NEAR, AURORA, and other cryptocurrencies.

And with NearPay Prepaid Visa Card, day-to-day payments can be made in crypto anywhere Visa is accepted.

Ref Finance

One more platform running on NEAR that benefits from NEAR’s low fees, 1-2 second finality, and WebAssembly-based runtime is Ref Finance. As a community-led and multi-purpose DeFi project, it provides users with atomic transactions, multiple pools in one smart contract, and customizable pool fee. Ref Finance also enables trading, staking and stake farming as well as taking part in platform’s governance and votes for holders of its native REF token.

Roketo is a crypto streaming solution built on NEAR that offers full transparency for both instant and continuous payments. It serves as a vesting and airdrop solution and makes setting up and handling payrolls a breeze, all whilst providing full control and the utmost safety. Roketo supports NEAR, OCT, REF, and other NEP-141 tokens that take a minimum amount of time to proceed (typically less than one minute).

Trisolaris

Trisolaris is an Aurora-powered decentralized exchange considered to be the most popular solution for trading in terms of total value locked (TLV) and volume built on NEAR’s Aurora EVM. It allows users to swap, pool, and farm, and earn fair revenue and boasts low-fee, lightning-fast transactions. Trisolaris is backed up by $TRI, the platform’s native token that helps TRI-based farm users earn higher yields. Trading experience on Trisolaris is similar to native Ethereum for a fraction of the cost.

That’s just part of exciting projects that unlock the limitless potential of NEAR Protocol. You can find the full list of the NEAR ecosystem’s project on AwesomeNEAR that was made by NEARFans, a NEAR-based DAO that consists of founders, investors, artists, designers, developers, and product managers who have been navigating the crypto waters since 2012.

NEARCON

Today, the NEAR community counts over 500 000 enthusiasts who intend to accelerate the adoption of Web3. For the purpose of gathering together the best and the brightest minds supporting the prosperity of NEAR, the massive event called NEARCON was created and has already taken place twice. The first conference was held in October 2021 as a grand celebration of the Near mainnet first anniversary while the second one rocked Lisbon this September.

NEARCON Beta became a great mix of the conference itself, festival and an intensive 48 hour in-person hackathon, showcasing more than 700 projects being built on NEAR that were launched in less than a year. The event managed to unite 2,000+ attendees and 300+ developers who are currently contributing to the protocol enhancement and are eager to start building on NEAR.

Over 180 keynote speakers delivered 128 sessions across 4 stages with Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder NEAR Protocol, Marieke Flament, CEO NEAR Foundation, and Alex Shevchenko, CEO Aurora Labs, topping the 2022 lineup of featured experts.

Final Thoughts

The NEAR’s ever-growing ecosystem is a vivid example of how the rate of Web3 adoption increases. As the DeFi sector develops and matures, more businesses and individuals start exploring the technology behind it, creating a huge room for different use cases to emerge.

By educating people and making the transition between Web2 and Web3 as smooth as possible, NEAR has all chances to become a game-changing project and mitigate all existing drawbacks like scalability and cross-chain operability that prevent the mass adoption on a global scale.

2022-10-26,How Binance’s Investment in Ankr Paid Off in Millions - CoinCodex,"Back in August, Binance Labs announced an investment into Ankr. Ankr, a well-known provider of Web 3 infrastructure, has long-standing partnerships with systems like Polygon, AAVE, Avalanche, SushiSwap and more, making their alliance with Binance another large name in their field.

Binance Labs' investment went into increasing the functionality of Ankr’s RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service, further helping to build the offering of what Ankr’s Web 3 systems can offer to developers.

A few months after this investment, Ankr was one of the leading preventers of millions of dollars being siphoned off the platform. In this article, we’ll break down Binance’s investment into Ankr, demonstrating why this deal came about, and how it paid off so remarkably for Binance Labs.

Let’s get right into it.

What is Ankr?

Founded back in 2017, Ankr has built up its network into a primary Web 3 system. Ankr is one of the fastest Web 3 infrastructures in the world, providing developers with the perfect system to launch their DApp creations on.

Currently, Ankr processes over 7.2 billion API requests on a daily basis, covering the daily uses of over 39,000 developers. As an international community with a remote workforce, Ankr’s 24/7 availability has made it the go-to for many blockchain companies. Currently, there are over 18 supported networks within Ankr, helping developers to integrate into whichever ecosystem they see fit.

As a decentralized and chain-neutral system, Ankr is helping the world to build a multi-chain future.

Why Did Binance Partner with Ankr?

Although this investment was strictly under wraps until its announcement, it’s not a particularly surprising venture for Binance Labs. Alongside Ankr’s popularity within the Web 3 community, it has actually already had a great deal of interaction with Binance.

Ankr had already contributed to the BNB Liquid Staking and BNB Chain system, their open-source contributions becoming a primary part of the BNB Chain infrastructure. Beyond in-ecosystem development, Ankr has also upgraded the Archive and Erigon Nodes, helping to push the utility of the Binance system.

The latter Erigon system upgrades focused on reducing BNB Chain’s requirements for storage, helping to create a much more efficient system. Equally, its integration into the system allowed the RPC process to streamline its performance, as well as helping to improve the synchronization process.

In short, Ankr is no stranger to BNB Chain. Considering their current upward trend in terms of how often they’re being integrated into blockchain systems, and their prior work with Binance, it was only a matter of time.

Ankr’s main position within this partnership is to help BNB Chain scale their operations further, increasing the total number of transactions that can be handled in a day. With this increase, there’s room to bring more customers onto the platform, as well as boost the utility of the BNB token itself.

How Ankr Helped BNB Chain Handle Its $100 Million Hack Exploit

A little over two months after Binance Lab’s investment into Ankr, their decision paid off incredibly. In early October, BNB Chain experienced an exploit, with hackers making off with over $100M of stolen capital that they minted on one of the system’s main bridges. While $100 million may seem like a hefty sum, this pales in comparison to the total amount that they were attempting to steal - nearly $560M of BNB.

The main reason that the hackers were thwarted so early into their mint and liquidate strategy was because BNB Chain’s validators noticed a discrepancy in the activity on the bridge. By freezing the ecosystem, these validators were able to then help BNB Chain to stop the majority of the newly-minted funds from leaving the platform.

Out of these validators, Ankr was among the first to respond, quickly notifying the other validators to spring into action. Alongside this rapid response leading to less money leaking from the platform, Ankr’s RPC was also fundamental in getting BNB Chain back up and running.

After freezing, BNB Chain went through a Hard Fork to prevent any further exploits from occurring. While other validators took time to adjust to this large-scale change, Ankr’s RPC stayed pegged to the BNB Chain, allowing their systems to get back up and running instantly.

Instead of further delaying the reactivation of DApps on the platform, the availability of Ankr’s RPC service allowed this system to continue on as normal, mirroring the ecosystem’s recovery.

Not only did their response help to prevent more money from being stolen from the platform, but the technology that Binance Labs had invested in a few months prior led to an incredible response speed after the Hard Fork.

Final Thoughts

In short, the investment that Binance Labs made into Ankr paid off in as little as two months. By focusing on their RPC infrastructure, Binance was able to increase the functionality of its platform. Especially in the aforementioned crisis, the rapid response that Ankr demonstrated allowed for the worst of the event to be avoided.

Ankr’s actions further show why this Web 3 infrastructure provider has gained such a positive image within the blockchain community. Alongside boosting utility, its investment in security and responsiveness has made it one of the leading mechanisms in response to a crisis event.

Binance Labs certainly lucked out with this partnership.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNTMzL2hvdy1iaW5hbmNlcy1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWluLWFua3ItcGFpZC1vZmYtaW4tbWlsbGlvbnMv0gFcaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjA1MzMvaG93LWJpbmFuY2VzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tYW5rci1wYWlkLW9mZi1pbi1taWxsaW9ucy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-22,How to stake Fantom (FTM)? - Cointelegraph,"Fantom (FTM) is known for its speed and inexpensive layer-1 blockchain. Like other blockchains (for example, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX)) that scale better than their counterpart, it has been dubbed an “Ethereum killer.” After raising $40 million in funds, Fantom launched its mainnet in December 2019. Since then, it has grown to become one of the most popular blockchains, sitting in the top 10 blockchains by total value locked (TVL) with $1.3 billion in TVL.

Fantom’s high-throughput blockchain is an open-source smart contract platform. It is scalable and EVM-compatible, meaning you can deploy and run your Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) on Fantom. Its structure enables the support for its decentralized finance (DeFi), other than managing digital assets and DApps.

The Fantom consensus mechanism is an adapted version of proof-of-stake, and it’s called Lachesis. It’s been designed to provide high-speed transactions, low fees and almost instant finality due to the aBFT algorithm. aBFT can scale to many nodes worldwide in a permissionless, open-source environment, offering a good level of decentralization.

The Fantom blockchain is powered by its native FTM token, and if you believe in the project and want to grow your FTM stack, you can consider staking Fantom to earn passive income.

What is Fantom staking?

Staking is making a blockchain more secure by locking up an investor’s digital assets for a certain amount of time. This security is provided by validators who validate transactions with their staked tokens, which becomes an economic incentive for them to behave according to the protocol’s rules.

By staking FTM, investors actively participate in securing its network while earning passive income, i.e., FTM rewards. Staking means that tokens will have to be locked up for some time; however, they will still be sitting in the owners’ wallets, only they can access and unlock their funds anytime.

How to stake FTM

The minimum stake amount to run a validator is 500,000 FTM to prevent Sybil attacks on its consensus mechanism. Sybil attacks are malicious attacks that involve falsifying multiple identities to gain an undue advantage within a network. As the validator’s required amount is relatively high, it becomes easier to delegate FTM to a validator.

A few Fantom staking strategies can be used:

Fluid staking: Investors can lock up their FTM token from two weeks to 365 days for better returns. The reward varies according to the length of the staking period; the longer FTMs are staked, the higher the reward rate. Liquid staking: Investors can mint sFTM for improved ROI when liquid staking. They can also stake farmed tokens, participate in liquidity mining, farm LP rewards and more. Custodial staking: Investors can take FTM on a centralized exchange (CEX) like Binance or Coinbase. The staking reward is 1%.

To stake on Fantom, users can follow these simple steps:

Have a minimum of 1 FTM to stake; Go to the Fantom staking page and click Stake your FTM;

You can log in with a compatible wallet, like MetaMask. You can open the wallet from your computer or your mobile device. You can create a new wallet or access an existing one using a mnemonic or seed phrase. Deposit your FTM by transferring them from an exchange or another wallet to your Fantom Opera wallet address. Click on “Staking.” Add a delegation by choosing a validator and an amount. Select your lock-up period and confirm.

There are a few options when it comes to optimal Fantom wallets. The Fantom Opera network is a second-layer and EVM-compatible blockchain, meaning that you can use any wallet that works for Ethereum, such as MetaMask, the Coinbase Wallet or a cold wallet like Ledger.

After creating an account on Fantom, you can also download your Fantom wallet (fwallet) by clicking on the “Create Wallet” button:

Where to stake FTM?

Other than its native blockchain network, Fantom can be staked across many platforms, including decentralized exchanges (DEX) and custodial blockchains. Here we’ll look at the places to stake Fantom so you can decide which is the most suitable.

How to stake Fantom on Ledger

Staking through a hardware wallet like Ledger works through a smart contract interaction, like other transactions. It’s sufficient to stake from the Fantom fWallet by signing Fantom FTM Ledger Nano S application. Then, use the “Stake” menu item on your account.

How to stake Fantom on Coinbase

In September 2021, Fantom announced support for the Fantom network on the Coinbase Wallet. Coinbase Wallet users can access and use the Fantom network and engage with Fantom DApps. Users can connect their Coinbase Wallet account to their Fantom fWallet and conduct activities such as stake FTM and earn rewards.

How to stake Fantom on Binance

To stake FTM on Binance, you have to deposit a convenient amount on the exchange, then go to Binance Earn and pick the suitable product for you; usually, it’s a locked up period of 30, 60, or 120 days. You can choose a more extended staking period for higher returns up to 14%.

How to stake Fantom on Kucoin

Similarly to Binance, you must deposit your FTM token on Kucoin and go to Kucoin Earn. Then click “Subscribe” to pick the product that suits you better, based on rewards and the time you want to lock your assets.

Is it safe to stake FTM?

It is safe to stake FTM because the validator node cannot access your staked tokens; make sure not to lose your mnemonic phrase or private key. However, like in other proof-of-stake blockchains, you risk losing a fraction of your stake if the validator is not reputable and misbehaves. It’s safer to select reputable Fantom validators who always have active communities, websites and Twitter accounts.

How to stake other tokens on Fantom

Fantom provides a flexible and dynamic ecosystem enabling the staking of several DeFi tokens to earn passive income on your investment. To use any of the following systems to stake their native tokens, you need a MetaMask or any other wallet mentioned above connected to the Fantom Opera network. In this case, Fantom staking acts like a CEX, such as Binance, becoming a marketplace where non-native cryptocurrencies are traded.

Here are some of the most popular tokens that are based and can be staked on Fantom:

Spookyswap is the biggest DEX on Fantom, with $777 million TVL and BOO being its native token, which can be bonded with FTM for maximum liquidity and to yield farm. To stake BOO, buy the tokens in an exchange or swap them in Spookyswap; connect your wallet to Fantom Opera to view your positions and start earning.

BeethovenX is a community-driven DEX, an automated market maker (AMM) and a DeFi powerhouse. Governed by BEETS native token and living on the Fantom Opera and Optimism chain, it yields an APR of 31%. To stake Beets, after depositing some FTM, connect your wallet to Fantom Opera and follow the procedure to choose a validator and the locking time.

QiDao is an autonomous and community-governed protocol that sits on Fantom and allows you to borrow stablecoins with zero interest against your crypto assets used as collateral. Loans are paid and repaid in miTokens (stablecoin soft pegged to the USD).

Scream is another decentralized lending protocol powered by Fantom, similar to platforms like Compound (COMP) and Aave (AAVE). Users who stake SCREAM tokens can earn around 58% APR, while for liquidity providers, the rewards can be as high as 82% APR.

How to run a Fantom node

Validators run full nodes and are a crucial part of the Fantom network. By running a full node, validators participate in the consensus to boost security and generate new blocks. There are some technical requirements and skills to be considered to run a Fantom full node, and it might be more suitable for a techie operator.

Following are the requirements necessary to run a Fantom full node:

Minimum requirement: 500,000 FTM

Maximum validator size: 15x the self-stake amount

Minimum hardware requirements: AWS EC2 m5.xlarge with four vCPUs (3.1 GHz) and at least 4.5 TB of Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage (or equivalent).

Rewards: currently ~13% APY (Normal APY on self-stake + 15% of delegators' rewards). APY varies based on staked %. For up-to-date APY, check the Fantom Foundation website.

A step-by-step guide to running a full-node

Users can run a node on their hardware or use a cloud provider. One of the big cloud providers, e.g., Amazon AWS, is recommended. They can set up a non-root user. Install the required building tools; install Go and then Opera. Register their Fantom validator node on-chain. To do this, users need to create a validator wallet that becomes the validator’s identity in the network, required to authenticate, sign messages, etc. Run their own node. To do this, they need to restart their node in validator mode, then close the Opera window by typing “exit.” Then they need to head back to the window where they started their node with the following command:

(validator)$ nohup ./opera --genesis $NETWORK --nousb --validator.id ID --validator.pubkey 0xPubkey --validator.password /path/to/password &

Users can refer to Fantom’s instructions for full specifications and details on how to run a validator node.

How much money can you make staking Fantom?

You can earn 5.01% if you choose the minimum lock-up period (14 days) and the minimum amount. The maximum APY is currently 15.31% for the maximum lock-up period of 365 days.

The FTM staking rewards calculator will estimate how much can be earned by staking Fantom.

FTM and most crypto tokens have dropped by over 90% during the 2022 bear market; therefore, staking will grow the number of your tokens but not necessarily the overall value. It’s also worth considering that staking and locking your tokens up may make your funds illiquid and exiting a position difficult.

2022-10-24,Binance P2P Is Turning 3—My Experiences with P2P Crypto Trading - CoinCodex,"As the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance marks its 3rd year of joining the P2P game. I’ll be sharing my experience with the Binance P2P platform and the reason why I choose it over other peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms.

If you're a beginner and yet to get acquainted with the P2P method of trading digital assets, this experience might seem odd to you. Hence, let's first delve a little into what P2P trading is all about and how it differs from the more common approach of trading crypto through orderbooks on an exchange.

Peer-to-peer trading is the oldest form of crypto trading, and it has been around practically ever since Bitcoin was invented. It is a trading approach in which a buyer and seller personally agree to a deal and then trade their assets directly with each other.

While trading through orderbooks is highly efficient, it’s not suitable for everyone. This is because cryptocurrency exchanges usually only support a limited number of funding options. In peer-to-peer trading, on the other hand, you can use a wide range of payment methods to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, so long as the person you’re trading with is fine with your payment method of choice.

Without further ado, let’s take a look at why Binance P2P is my go-to platform for my peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading.

Trade crypto on Binance P2P

Why do I use Binance P2P?

I started using the Binance P2P platform after the monetary authorities in my country placed a strict ban on the use of bank accounts that are directly connected with cryptocurrency exchanges.

As a crypto trader who didn’'t want to take on the risks associated with transacting in the open market, I had a lot to worry about. The thought of my crypto possibly falling into the hands of fraudsters was very discouraging.

Fortunately, my worries faded after my first encounter with Binance P2P 2 years ago. Binance P2P was a game changer for me considering the situation in my country at the time. The platform gave me the opportunity to trade my crypto assets while connecting directly with traders from different parts of the world without the fear of losing my funds to fraudsters. This opportunity also comes with the added benefit of being able to comfortably choose a payment method that I am most comfortable with out of the hundreds featured on the platform.

Due to its friendly user interface, Binance P2P can be used by expert crypto traders and beginners alike. If you’re interested, you can get started now by getting an account and experiencing Binance P2P for yourself.

As for the cryptocurrencies that are supported by Binance P2P, BNB, BTC, ETH and USDT are just a few examples.

Why choose Binance P2P?

Although there are a lot of P2P platforms in the crypto market today, Binance P2P offers probably the best peer-to-peer trading experience among all of them. Here are some of the platform’s most unique and useful features which make it stand out above the rest.

Binance P2P enhances security through escrow

Relating back to my experience with Binance P2P, the platform allows you to trade your assets without having to be afraid of thieves or scammers. Basically, Binance P2P adopts a holding mechanism for assets that have been placed on order. The platform uses escrow to pin down the assets as a form of protection. The assets are then released to the deserving party after the necessary confirmations have been made. This way, bad actors can’t claim the assets without completing their part of the transaction.

Swift transactions and zero fees

Here's another feature to love about Binance P2P. The platform offers users easy and fast transactions with no extra cost. Binance P2P users save more money while executing transactions as they do not need to bother paying for fees.

Global support

Binance P2P currently offers its services to over 14 million traders from all around the globe. This covers over 252 regions and countries of the world. This simply means there are thousands of buyers and sellers on the platform waiting to connect with you. As such, there's no difficulty in finding a buyer or seller that is willing to accept the payment method proposed. Furthermore, the platform supports hundreds of fiat currencies and third-party payment solutions.

Promotional offers for celebrating Binance P2P’s 3-year milestone

Since its launch in 2019, the Binance team has been working to improve the efficiency of the Binance P2P platform. To mark the Binance P2P 3rd year of existence, the platform has planned to celebrate this milestone with a bunch of exciting activities coming to the platform soon.

Binance swag and a 43,000 BUSD prize pool

In celebration of Binance P2P turning 3, the platform has also promised its users exclusive Binance swag items following certain criteria. With a prize pool of 43,000 BUSD, users who are able to meet the platform's stated qualifications will have the opportunity to earn significant rewards.

100% Maker Fee Rebate

Binance P2P has promised a 100% maker fee rebate in celebration of its 3 years of existence. This offer is available to users who post advertisements and trade in any local currency on Binance P2P.

However, participants must meet certain criteria's to be deemed eligible for this activity. Participants must first complete P2P trades with at least five unique counterparties during the period of the promo. Next, the participants must ensure they have achieved up to 95% overall order completion rate before the promo elapses. Also, the participants must accumulate a total trading volume of at least $5,000 equivalent (including buys and sells) on Binance P2P during the same period.

According to the platform, participants who are able to make it to the top 50 will be awarded a 100% rebate on maker fees. This is an opportunity to earn up to 200 BUSD in a cashback voucher.

Meanwhile, Binance users must note that only users who trade with the Binance P2P will be considered eligible to participate in any of the promo offers.

How to use Binance P2P?

Here is a step by step guide for users to understand how to use the Binance P2P platform. Note, the platform adopts a very friendly user interface. As such, the processes are easy to follow and understand.

Firstly, interested persons should get a Binance account and complete the Identity Verification process as directed on the platform. A few documents are required to complete the verification process.

After a successful verification process, you now have access to Binance P2P. Hence, you can proceed to setting up the payment method most suitable to you. Binance P2P supports more than 300 payment methods, hence there are various options to choose from.

After completing the aforementioned step, you are now ready to start trading on the Binance P2P platform.

On occasions when you want to sell your crypto assets, you should transfer the assets from your Binance spot wallets to your Binance funding wallets. This way, the assets can be available to sell on Binance P2P.

On occasions when you want to buy crypto assets on P2P, click on ads from buyers displayed on the platform who meet your requirements.

Users who intend to buy crypto assets on Binance P2P have to place an order on a matching ads, pay the seller via the suggested payment method as displayed on the order, and then you have the escrowed assets released into your wallet once the payment is confirmed by the seller.

Users who intend to sell their crypto assets via Binance P2P are required to place an order which immediately causes the assets to be escrowed by the platform. Next, once the platform notifies that payment has been made by the supposed buyer, you should check if you've truly received the payment and confirm the payment immediately. If the payment has been confirmed, you should proceed to releasing the crypto.

Final thoughts—Binance P2P is one of the best options for P2P crypto trading

With Binance P2P celebrating its third anniversary, it is amazing how the platform has managed to attain significant milestones within just a few years operations. Its unique features have made it a go-to platform for every crypto user who desires to connect directly to traders from all parts of the world.

2022-10-06,European Council Passes MiCA Crypto Regulation – A Turning ... - Cryptonews,"European Council Passes MiCA Crypto Regulation – A Turning Point for Crypto Landscape

The European Council on Wednesday passed the new MiCA crypto regulation, which by many is seen as a turning point for Europe’s crypto industry.

The new bill, with the full name Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), has now been voted through the European Council but still needs to pass an additional vote in the European Parliament next week.

The next step after MiCA has also passed the European Parliament will be to translate the full text into the more than 20 official languages of the EU. The bill includes a 12-18-month adaptation period meant to help companies adjust to the new regulations.

The bill aims to regulate all crypto-related activities, and especially the issuance of cryptocurrencies, that take place within the European Union. Notably, the bill will also bring much more stringent oversight for companies that are defined as so-called crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).

Among the requirements that will be placed on CASPs under the new rules is legal liability for the companies if they lose their clients’ cryptoassets. The rule covers all centralized companies in the crypto space, including wallet providers of ‘hosted’ or custodial wallets, but not so-called ‘unhosted wallets’ otherwise known as crypto wallets where the private keys are controlled by users.

Notably, the new regulations do not include a ban on proof-of-work (PoW) mining, as was originally proposed.

The EU first reached an agreement on MiCA in July this year. Back then, representatives of the crypto industry, such as Rebecca Rettig, a board member at the crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, applauded the effort to “provide clarity in the crypto space” while also noting that there is “more work to be done.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9ldXJvcGVhbi1jb3VuY2lsLXBhc3Nlcy1taWNhLWNyeXB0by1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLXR1cm5pbmctcG9pbnQtZm9yLWNyeXB0by1sYW5kc2NhcGUuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-30,SWEAT x Ref Finance: The comprehensive bridging & staking user ... - Medium,"SWEAT x Ref Finance: The comprehensive bridging & staking user guide Ref Finance · Follow 6 min read · Sep 30, 2022 -- 1 Listen Share

Sweat Economy, 2022 number 1 downloaded health and fitness app with more than 120 Million users, just successfully launched its TGE event on Near & Ethereum on Sept 13th. The SWEAT Token was then listed on Ref finance immediately, followed by a SWEAT-NEAR farm on Sep 14 with triple tokens rewards.

If you are a SWEAT holder, and your tokens are still on a CEX or Ethereum, or they’re still in your SWEAT app, but you want to farm with them on Ref Finance, this user guide is perfect for you.

What’s required?

In order to join this farm, you will need 2 tokens, which are obviously NEAR and SWEAT, and a NEAR wallet.

NEAR Wallet

If you don’t have a NEAR Wallet yet, you can create one in under 5 minutes with a non-custodial wallet such as MyNearWallet, Sender, or you can use a Ledger.

The NEAR Token

You can buy NEAR on most of the big exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken etc. or you can buy via some fiat off-ramp solutions such as NEAR Pay, Moon pay, or Transak, which have been directly integrated into the Ref finance UI.

The SWEAT Token

If you are a native Near user, you can buy SWEAT directly on Ref finance; But if you’re not a native Near user, and your SWEAT tokens are on a CEX or Ethereum or they’re still in your SWEAT app, there are ways to bring them to the NEAR blockchain.

How to get SWEAT from CEXs to Near

Since the TGE, SWEAT has been listed on numerous exchanges such as OKX, Bitfinex, FTX, Kucoin, Bybit, Huobi and Gate, which makes access to it super easy.

However, not every exchange supports withdrawals to the NEAR network. As we understand, so far OKX, Kucoin, Bybit, and Huobi are the exchanges that allow users to withdraw their SWEAT to NEAR.

This time, we are going to use Bybit as an example.

After you’ve got your SWEAT tokens ready, go to your Spot Wallet, and here you can see the option to Withdraw.

On the pop-up window:

Choose your Chain Type as NEAR( or NEP-141) Fill in your Wallet Address that ends with .near Enter the amount you want to withdraw (Notice that there will be a withdrawal fee, the amount depends on the exchange)

Hit Submit after you’ve confirmed everything.

Finish with some Verification steps and it’s done!

How to get SWEAT from Ethereum to Near

If you are a participant of SWEAT IDO on MakerDAO or you bought your SWEAT on Ethereum, check out the tutorial below.

You can bridge SWEAT from Ethereum to NEAR via Wormhole, aka Portal Bridge.

First, go to https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer

Choose the route Ethereum > NEAR, then connect your Ethereum wallet.

Next, choose the token we’re about to bridge, which in this case will be SWEAT.

Enter the amount you want to bridge, then hit Next

Connect your NEAR Wallet in the next step, and continue by hitting Next.

You will need to Approve Portal Bridge to transfer your tokens in the next step, you can choose to allow the bridge to spend infinitely so you don’t have to approve next time, or you can choose to approve only the amount you are about to send.

After the Approval step, it’s time to transfer the tokens. Simple hit the Transfer button, confirm the transaction in your wallet and you’re good to go.

Bridging can take quite some time, ideally around 10–15 minutes.

The final step is Redeeming the tokens, just need to hit Redeem and you are done! Easy right?

How to get SWEAT from The Sweat Wallet to Near

Sweat wallet is the app you need to download in order to manage the tokens you’ve collected from walking in the main app. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, find it here.

Hit the Transfer button, and choose Send.

Enter your NEAR address, and hit Continue.

Fill in the amount you want to transfer, and hit Continue.

Slide the glider, once you’ve confirmed everything.

And done, no sweat! :)

How to farm with SWEAT on Ref finance

Head to https://app.ref.finance/, go to the Farm page, and look for the SWEAT <> NEAR farm.

In order to farm, you will first need to add liquidity to the pool to receive the LP tokens.

Here you will need both SWEAT and NEAR at a specific rate depending on the corresponding value of 2 tokens at the time you provide liquidity.

Liquidity farming is not without risks, it is strongly recommended that you should do your own research before making any decision. Ref finance has a Risk section that we recommend you give a look.

After you’ve added the liquidity, go back to the previous farm page and proceed to Stake the LP tokens, or Share

Enter any amount you like, and hit Stake.

Approve the transaction in your wallet and you are done!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcmVmLWZpbmFuY2UubWVkaXVtLmNvbS9zd2VhdC14LXJlZi1maW5hbmNlLXRoZS1jb21wcmVoZW5zaXZlLWJyaWRnaW5nLXN0YWtpbmctdXNlci1ndWlkZS0zYTk2NTA5MzY2ZjHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-12,Is ApeCoin the Next Cryptocurrency to Explode On APE Staking ... - Cryptonews,"Is ApeCoin the Next Cryptocurrency to Explode On APE Staking Launch

ApeCoin appears set to pump in the coming days and weeks ahead of staking for APE going live.

The coin has made steady gains in the last seven days, up 15% on the week and 7% in the last 24 hours, with more growth expected after Horizen Labs announced they would hold a Twitter Spaces on the subject on September 22.

It remains unclear when exactly staking will go live, with some holders expressing annoyance and disappointment on social media that it hasn't happened yet.

However, the general sentiment on APE is now bullish and the market could see more growth both pre- and post-staking going live, with investors rushing to buy up the coin and then take it off the market.

What is ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club?

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (often referred to as BAYC) is one of the premier NFT collections in crypto.

Despite billions being drained from the NFT market and many collections in the red, the cheapest BAYC is still on sale for 72 ETH (approx. $125,000) and during the NFT bull run last summer, multiple Bored Apes sold for tens of millions of dollars.

The collection has a number of celebrity backers, with Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Jimmy Fallon and many others.

The BAYC universe also includes other collections - the Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Bored Ape Kennel Club - which are secondary collections and go for significantly less but are still highly sought after.

ApeCoin is an ERC20 token that acts as that the governance token within the APE Ecosystem and the ApeCoin Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), it is a community-driven initiative allowing holders to vote on ideas, projects and other tasks within the ecosystem.

It also allows holders exclusive access to other things such as merchandise, events, premium games and services and we named it among our top 10 best new cryptos to buy.

APE reached an all-time high of $25 in May and although it's price has dropped significantly, it has remained in the top 40 coins by market cap based on the desirability of the Bored Ape ecosystem and the strength of the community, despite its general lack of utility compared to some projects.

What is APE Staking?

The ApeCoin DAO has released full details on what staking will entail.

But in summary, ApeCoin will be distributed to all Bored Ape and Mutant Ape holders that stake their NFTs plus APE coin. It offers great incentive for holders of the NFT to buy more APE with the sole intention of staking it and the more that do the higher the rewards will be.

However, for holders to generate max returns they have to hold a set amount of APE (10,094 for BAYC and 2,042 for MAYC) and many holders do not earn close to that.

Twitter user Ouroboros Capital has broken down APE staking, NFT holder wallets and the potential amount BAYC and MAYC holders could earn and concluded that APE will become a must buy for them soon.

Not only will that see increased demand but once staking goes lives, the supply of the coin is set to be sucked out of the market.

One alternative coin with similar growth potential in the coming weeks is Tamadoge.

The project is currently enjoying an extremely successful presale and has raised almost $15 million in just over a month, with around just 15% of the presale allocation remaining.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcGVjb2luLW5leHQtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktZXhwbG9kZS1hcGUtc3Rha2luZy1sYXVuY2guaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-09-01,"No, Terra Classic Isn't Going to $1. Here's Why - Crypto Briefing","Key Takeaways Luna Classic is planning to implement a new 1.2% transaction tax burn mechanism.

The failed project's native coin, LUNC, has risen 171% on the week.

However, new investors should temper their expectations of the coin eventually hitting a dollar.

Share this article URL Copied

The Terra Classic community is planning to start burning more LUNC—but traders should be careful they don’t get burned themselves.

Terra Classic’s Revival

Terra Classic is attempting to make another run at relevance, thanks to support from its community.

When the UST stablecoin collapsed in May, many thought there was no hope left for Terra. Do Kwon, Terraform Labs’ infamous CEO, had quickly moved to establish a new Terra blockchain, relegating his failure to the name “Luna Classic” and rebranding the new chain’s native coin under the LUNA ticker.

However, since Terra’s untimely collapse, efforts to revive the original blockchain have progressed slowly. In June, a proposal to start burning a portion of the Terra Classic transaction fees and increase validator rewards showed that there was still motivation to develop the chain despite it being abandoned by Terraform Labs. Another proposal to start burning 1.2% of all tokens transacted also passed a community vote, though details on how such an idea could be implemented were absent.

All the while, LUNC, Terra Classic’s native coin, continued trading. Volatility was high but not wholly unexpected given its low level of liquidity. The few active developers in the Terra Classic ecosystem was enough to fuel speculation. As is often the case with crypto tokens that trade at a fraction of a cent, hope kicked in for LUNC to one day trade at a single penny or, for the more ambitious (read: deluded), a dollar. Such a move would put LUNC market capitalization in the trillions, a fact that its biggest shills refused to acknowledge.

Fast forward to today, and a recent proposal from Terra community member Edward Kim has helped reignite enthusiasm for Terra Classic. Kim’s proposal puts forward an actionable path toward implementing the 1.2% burn tax on all on-chain transactions. In his post on the Terra Classic forums, he explains the possible pros and cons of such an update and invites discussion from other community members. In response, LUNC has hit a new local peak, trading at its highest since the May collapse.

But what exactly does burning and taxing Luna Classic transactions hope to achieve? How will the community be able to enforce the tax on centralized exchanges? These are just a couple of the questions the Terra Classic community needs to address in the lead-up to an event that could spark a significant amount of volatility.

Burn Tokens, Get Money?

Burning tokens is a straightforward concept to understand. When the supply of something is reduced, but the demand stays the same, it follows that the price people are willing to pay will increase. It’s no coincidence that many of the most popular and widely adopted crypto projects incorporate a burn mechanic into their tokenomics. Shiba Inu’s developers routinely burn chunks of its supply, and Binance’s BNB also conducts quarterly token burns, much to the applause of holders.

However, in many cases, burning tokens does little to impact actual supply and demand metrics. In the case of BNB, almost all of what’s burned comes from a reserve of tokens the exchange has held since launch. It makes for a good headline when Binance touts it has burned millions of dollars worth of BNB, but in reality, those tokens were never in circulation. It’s not surprising, then, that such events have historically failed to impact BNB’s price.

What token burns do accomplish, though, is creating a strong narrative that even the most novice crypto investor can understand and get behind. It matters not whether a burn mechanism will significantly shrink a token’s supply and push prices up. By hyping up a token burn enough, the price will often rise anyway because people buy in anticipation of a perceived reduction in supply.

For Luna Classic, its planned token burn tax will likely do nothing more than create an excellent narrative to draw in naïve investors. The vast majority of LUNC trading occurs off-chain on centralized exchanges such as Binance, Kucoin, and Gate.io. That means even if the Terra Classic community successfully implemented a 1.2% burn tax on transactions, only a tiny fraction of LUNC would end up burned. While many members of the LUNC community have petitioned exchanges like Binance to implement their burn tax, it looks extremely unlikely that any will.

It’s also worth noting that since Terra Classic re-enabled staking earlier this year, large holders and validators have been taking advantage of its outsized staking rewards. Because few people have bothered delegating their LUNC to validators since the chain’s collapse, rewards are split between fewer people, resulting in an average annualized return of over 37%. These early stakers now have fully-loaded bags ready to dump on new investors who are convinced Luna Classic’s upcoming token burn will shrink the supply and send it to a dollar.

Ultimately, Luna Classic has little fundamental reason to be valued as highly as it is, even at fractions of a cent. There’s no reason for serious developers to start building on the chain, and those currently involved seem to view it more as a hobby than a serious investment. Of course, this doesn’t mean LUNC can’t go parabolic again, but it can just as easily plummet when those pumping up the price decide to jump ship. For the gamblers out there, be warned: don’t get caught holding the bag when the music stops. And it will stop.

2022-10-25,Chinese agents used Bitcoin transactions through Wasabi to allegedly bribe US government employee - Cointelegraph,"The United States Department of Justice has announced charges against two Chinese intelligence officers who allegedly bribed a double agent with Bitcoin.

In an Oct. 24 announcement, the Justice Department said Guochun He and Zheng Wang attempted to obstruct the prosecution of an unnamed global telecommunications company based in China, which allegedly involved paying a U.S. government employee roughly $61,000 in bribes using Bitcoin (BTC). However, the individual was a double agent working on behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and did not move against authorities in the Eastern District of New York in the case against the China-based company.

According to an analysis by cryptocurrency risk management firm Elliptic, He and Wang used Wasabi Wallet to conceal the BTC transactions allegedly used for bribes. The firm reported that the privacy wallet had previously been used in an attempt to launder BTC from the July 2020 Twitter hack and the attacks on crypto exchanges Bitfinex in 2016 and KuCoin in 2020.

“The same properties of digital assets that make them attractive to criminals — such as censorship resistance, pseudonymity and the ease with which they can be transferred across borders — also make them valuable tools for all intelligence agencies looking to fund clandestine operations,” said Elliptic.

Source: Elliptic

According to the Justice Department, the two Chinese intelligence officers began the scheme in 2019 by directing the double agent to steal confidential information related to the prosecution of the company — which Elliptic suggested may be Huawei. He allegedly made separate bribes of $41,000 and $20,000 in BTC to the agent for providing “secret” documents and rewarding the release of information, respectively.

Following the creation of the Justice Department’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team in October 2021, the government department has taken many enforcement actions against individuals and entities using crypto for illicit actions including money laundering and related to cybercrimes. In 2022, the Department of Justice seized roughly $500,000 in fiat and crypto from a hacking group tied to the North Korean government, and it has taken steps to move forward on a criminal prosecution case against a U.S. citizen who allegedly violated sanctions through crypto.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmVzZS1hZ2VudHMtdXNlZC1iaXRjb2luLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9ucy10aHJvdWdoLXdhc2FiaS10by1hbGxlZ2VkbHktYnJpYmUtdXMtZ292ZXJubWVudC1lbXBsb3llZdIBhAFodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmVzZS1hZ2VudHMtdXNlZC1iaXRjb2luLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9ucy10aHJvdWdoLXdhc2FiaS10by1hbGxlZ2VkbHktYnJpYmUtdXMtZ292ZXJubWVudC1lbXBsb3llZS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-21,Stay Safe and Avoid Scams on P2P Trading Platforms — How to Protect Your Funds on Binance P2P - CoinCodex,"P2P (peer-to-peer) cryptocurrency trading allows you to buy or sell cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum directly with other users, using an agreed-upon currency and payment method. P2P trading can be a very effective way to buy cryptocurrency as you can avoid fees and use the payment method that suits you best.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, offers a platform called Binance P2P where cryptocurrency buyers and sellers can quickly connect with each other and arrange P2P trades. Generally speaking, Binance P2P is one of the safest platforms that’s available to P2P cryptocurrency traders today.

Trade crypto on Binance P2P

Regardless, we have to point out that there’s certain risks involved with P2P trading that apply no matter which platform you’re using. This is because dishonest users will attempt to steal money from you through various deceptive tactics. Thankfully, these scams are easy to spot and avoid as long as you follow some simple guidelines.

In this article, we’ll be giving you some tips on how you can quickly detect scamming attempts and protect your funds. We’ll mostly be focused on the Binance P2P platform, but some of these tips also apply to other P2P cryptocurrency trading scenarios.

Spotting scam attempts

The first step towards protecting your funds from scammers is to learn how to quickly spot scam attempts and suspicious behaviour. Here are some of the most common methods used by scammers and what you should watch out for.

Chargeback scams

Some scammers will attempt to perform a chargeback after receiving cryptocurrency through a P2P trade. In such a scenario, the scammer would send you money for your cryptocurrency as arranged on the P2P marketplace. After the transaction is complete and they receive your crypto, the scammer will then try to trigger a chargeback to get the money back into their account while keeping your cryptocurrency.

You should always check that the money is already in your bank account or wallet before approving any transaction on Binance P2P. You should also make screenshots of your transactions so you have proof that will help you resolve any potential issues when contacting customer support.

It’s also important to research different payment methods and try to identify which ones are less likely to approve frivolous chargeback requests.

Fake receipts

Scammers might use fake information to manipulate you into thinking they completed their end of a P2P trade. For example, they could doctor a screenshot to supposedly show that they sent the payment to your account, and use it to pressure you into sending your cryptocurrency to them. In reality, they haven’t sent any funds, and plan to run off with your crypto after receiving it.

The best way to counter this type of scam is to take your time and verify that you have actually received the funds you were supposed to receive. Don’t allow yourself to be pressured—if someone is trying to get you to send your funds as quickly as possible, that is a red flag that they might be up to no good.

Wrong transfer scams

This type of scam is similar to the chargeback scam. After buying cryptocurrency from you through a P2P service, the scammer will attempt to make the transaction void by contacting their bank or payment service provider and claiming that they either sent funds to the wrong address, or had their account hacked.

In many cases, scammers will attempt to scare users into not reporting such events to authorities, often by claiming that the transaction was “illegal” in some way.

The best way to avoid scams of this sort is to take as many screenshots as possible, and save any correspondences you have with your P2P trading counterparties.

The best ways to protect yourself

While there will unfortunately always be scammers, Binance P2P makes it as difficult as possible for anyone to pull off any dishonest moves. The most important aspect of Binance P2P is the platform’s escrow service, which you are required to use when making trades on Binance P2P.

Binance P2P’s escrow service

The Binance P2P escrow service temporarily handles the funds involved in a P2P trade until both the buyer and the seller fulfill their part of the deal.

Let’s say that you are looking to buy cryptocurrency on Binance P2P, and find a seller that meets your requirements. After placing the order to buy cryptocurrency from them, the seller’s crypto will be held by the escrow service until they confirm that they received the payment from you. After this confirmation, the crypto will be released from escrow and sent to you, completing the trade.

The crypto needs to be temporarily held in escrow because sometimes, the counterparty will not fulfill their end of the deal. In such cases, the harmed user can open an appeal and Binance P2P can then review the appeal and distribute the funds held in escrow to their rightful owner.

It’s important to stress that you should always be using the escrow service with any buyer or seller you meet on the Binance P2P platform. If they are trying to convince you to complete the trade outside of the Binance P2P platform and to forego the escrow service, they are likely attempting to pull off some kind of scam.

Prioritize users with good feedback and account verification

The Binance P2P platform makes it easy to find trustworthy P2P traders with good feedback and a long history of completed trades. It’s unlikely that such traders would risk their good reputation by attempting to scam you.

When looking through the list of available offers, pay special attention to a trader’s number of completed orders, as well as the completion rate. Merchants that have a golden tick next to their name are verified, which means they have passed additional checks to determine they are experienced with P2P trading.

If you want to stay on the safe side, stick with traders that have a large number of completed trades and a high completion rate. If they’re also a verified merchant on top of that, you can be quite confident that you’ll be able to complete the trade without any issues.

An example of a trader with verified merchant status, a lot of completed trades and a high completion rate.

Never agree to pay any extra fees to the seller

Some users might be trying to scam you by asking you to pay an additional fee on top of the amount that you agreed upon. Binance P2P charges 0 fees for buyers and sellers, which means that anyone who’s asking you to pay an additional fee is acting dishonestly.

While you’re negotiating with another trader on Binance P2P, don’t hesitate to stop communications if you have any suspicions whatsoever. There’s many different users on the platform, so you will most likely be able to find another deal that suits you.

Avoid deals that seem too good to be true

When something seems too good to be true, it usually is. In the context of P2P trading, exercise caution with offers that seem very attractive. For example, someone might be offering to sell cryptocurrency significantly below the current market rate, or offering to buy cryptocurrency significantly above the current market rate.

These buyers and sellers might be trying to lure you into getting in contact with them, so they can manipulate you to steal your money or personal information.

The bottom line

Trading on Binance P2P is very safe as long as you follow the common-sense guidelines we’ve outlined above. If you want to learn even more ways of protecting yourself from scammers, you can check out these helpful articles prepared by Binance:

2022-09-08,Sweatcoin price prediction ahead of the SWEAT launch - CoinJournal,"Sweatcoin is the fastest growing fitness project in the world with over 113 million users globally. It is a move-to-earn (MTE) platform that has a close resemblance to StepN, the well-known platform on Solana’s ecosystem. In September, Sweatcoin will launch its SWEAT cryptocurrency that is believed to be the biggest launches this year. So, in this SWEAT price prediction, we will assess whether the coin is a good buy.

What is Sweatcoin?

Sweatcoin is a leading application that is at the intersection of two leading industries: fitness and blockchain. The platform is a mobile application that can be installed in both Android and iOS smartphones.

Sweatcoin rewards users for making basic exercises like walking and running. It is an accurate platform because it uses the inbuit GPS that is in a person’s phone. Users are then rewarded using the SWEAT token, which exists in its ecosystem.

Sweatcoin has had a lot of success in the past few months. According to its website, it now has over 113 million users and is the number one fitness application in most countries, including the US and the UK. The company has raised millions of dollars from venture capital companies.

What is the SWEAT crypto?

Presently, SWEAT coins that users earn in the ecosystem have no value in the real world. As a result, the developers partnered with NEAR Protocol to launch a new cryptocurrency based on those tokens.

After months of developments, the SWEAT crypto coin will be launched on September 13th of this year. As a result, existing holders will be awarded fresh new tokens that they can sell in listing cryptocurrency exchanges. People can also decide to hold their tokens and generate returns through staking.

After the launch, the developers hope to expand the network in various ways. For example, in their second phase, they will launch SWEAT NFTs and a DAo.

SWEAT price prediction

At this point, it is not possible to conduct a SWEAT price prediction since the coin has not been launched yet. Still, we believe that the coin’s price will dip initially as existing holders cash out for fiat currency. If this happens, the sell-off could be brutal as supply will exceed demand.

In the long-term, however, the coin will likely bounce back because of its strong user adoption and brand knowledge. Therefore, for people without SWEAT coins, it will be wise to wait before you buy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmpvdXJuYWwubmV0L25ld3Mvc3dlYXRjb2luLXByaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb24tYWhlYWQtb2YtdGhlLXN3ZWF0LWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-28,Modhaus Leverages NFTs to Let Community Decide Composition of the First Fan-Directed K-Pop Group - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Modhaus has completed the initial stages of the NFT voting process that will define which artists will earn a spot in the new K-Pop group called tripleS

Out of 32 artists that will ultimately be selected, the community has so far selected 8 members

During the voting event, called Gravity, 8,000 tripleS NFT owners cast over 4,400 votes

NFT holders have selected 8 tripleS members so far, with 24 more to be voted on

Modhaus, a Korean Pop culture-focused Web3 metaverse project, has successfully completed the first stage of the voting process that will decide which artists will represent tripleS, the first K-Pop group composed entirely by fans.

While voting on K-Pop group members is not uncommon, this is the first time that the voting is done via non-fungible tokens (NFTs). tripleS NFTs enable their holders to participate in the voting process, called Gravity, which will ultimately select 32 K-Pop group members.

During the first Gravity event that was held between September 21 and September 25, more than 8,000 NFT owners cast 4,417 votes, picking 8 group members in the process. In total, the event generated 4,728 unique transactions on Polygon. It is worth noting that each tripleS NFT mints one COMO, a voting token that is used exclusively for Gravity events.

So far, the composition of tripleS’ two sub-units, Acid Angel from Asia (AAA) and +(KR)ystal Eyes (KR), has been decided via NFT governance. While KR follows a more traditional K-Pop approach, AAA represents a new take on the popular genre, centered around a completely new and unique dance style.

Jaden Jeong, the founder and CEO of Modhaus and a prominent figure in the K-Pop community, has this to say about the success of NFT voting:

“The first Gravity was a smashing success, proving that fans are really curious to be directly involved in the fate of a group,” said Jaden Jeong. “Korean entertainment is really rich and authentic, and by revolutionizing how fans engage with it, we can really create something interesting and unique.”

Modhaus is on a mission to promote K-Entertainment around the globe, leveraging the popularity of hits such as Squid Game and BTS to appeal to mainstream Western audiences. In addition, the Web3 startup wants to do away with the current top-down K-Pop structure by instead putting the decision-making process into the hands of the broader K-Entertainment community.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2NvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTU4NC9tb2RoYXVzLWxldmVyYWdlcy1uZnRzLXRvLWxldC1jb21tdW5pdHktZGVjaWRlLWNvbXBvc2l0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1maXJzdC1mYW4tZGlyZWN0ZWQtay1wb3AtZ3JvdXAv0gGIAWh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE5NTg0L21vZGhhdXMtbGV2ZXJhZ2VzLW5mdHMtdG8tbGV0LWNvbW11bml0eS1kZWNpZGUtY29tcG9zaXRpb24tb2YtdGhlLWZpcnN0LWZhbi1kaXJlY3RlZC1rLXBvcC1ncm91cC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-09-29,"Terra Classic (LUNC) Price Soars As Exchanges, Platforms Aims To Burn 2.5 Trillion - CoinGape","Terra Classic (LUNC) price soars nearly 10% in the last 24 hours from a low of $0.00025 to a high of $0.00029. The price jumped after several crypto exchanges and platforms extended support for Terra Classic. In fact, Lithosphere network core developer KaJ Labs aims to burn 2.5 trillion LUNC tokens with the Jot Art Finesse NFT collection and mixed RPG play-to-earn “Finesse” gameplay.

Terra Classic (LUNC) Support by Crypto Exchanges and Platforms

Terra Classic has a total supply of 6.8 trillion. The community aims to reach a fixed supply of 10 billion LUNC tokens with the 1.2% tax burn or other burn mechanisms. Until now, 6.6 billion LUNC tokens have been burned, with 4.2 billion burned by sending to the burn address and 2.3 billion burned with tax.

The world’s largest exchange Binance’s support for Terra Classic burn for on-chain and off-chain transactions has led many other exchanges including KuCoin, Kraken, Huobi, Gate.io, MEXC Global, eToro, Crypto.com, CoinInn, BTCEX, and LBank to support the community.

Recently, other exchanges such as CEX·IO, Bitrue, Bitazza Global, etc. have extended support for the 1.2% tax burn mechanism. Moreover, other projects such as MetaRivals are also returning to the Terra Classic chain.

Interestingly, Lithosphere blockchain core developer KaJ Labs promises to allocate $50-$100 million for burning 2.5 trillion Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens. KaJ Labs expects the Lithosphere (LITHO) Jot Art Finesse NFT collection and mixed RPG play-to-earn “Finesse” games starting October 1.

While crypto exchanges aim to burn LUNC tokens until the supply reaches 10 billion, new projects and games plan to further reduce the LUNC supply. This will make the LUNC price jump significantly higher and the token becoming more deflationary.

LUNC Price Soars Amid Rising Burn Rate

After the 1.2% tax burn, the daily burn rate has reached over 450 million LUNC tokens. As a result, the Terra Classic (LUNC) price has jumped higher despite other factors such as the arrest warrant against Do Kwon.

In the last 24 hours, the Terra Classic price has soared nearly 10%, with the price currently trading at $0.00027.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmdhcGUuY29tL3RlcnJhLWNsYXNzaWMtbHVuYy1wcmljZS1zb2Fycy1hcy1leGNoYW5nZXMtcGxhdGZvcm1zLWFpbXMtdG8tYnVybi0yLTUtdHJpbGxpb24v0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9jb2luZ2FwZS5jb20vdGVycmEtY2xhc3NpYy1sdW5jLXByaWNlLXNvYXJzLWFzLWV4Y2hhbmdlcy1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtYWltcy10by1idXJuLTItNS10cmlsbGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

AMSTERDAM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The Dutch central bank on Thursday issued a statement saying cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin is operating in the Netherlands without being registered to do so.

KuCoin is a subsidiary of a Seychelles-registered company called MEK Global Limited (MGL), the bank said in a statement.

MGL ""is acting in violation of the law on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism and offering illegal services,"" De Nederlandsche Bank said.

KuCoin did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Customers of the exchange are not breaking the law, the DNB said, ""but they may have a heightened risk of becoming involved in money laundering and terrorism financing.""

In August 2021, the DNB issued a similar warning that Binance Holdings Ltd. was operating in the Netherlands without a license. That led to the company setting up an entity in the country and paying a $3.3 million fine in April 2022.

In a Dec. 15 announcement, the central bank said that MEK Global Limited, or MGL, which does business in the Netherlands as KuCoin, was not in compliance with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations. De Nederlandsche Bank added the crypto firm was “illegally offering services” as well as “illegally offering custodian wallets” for users.

“This means that MGL is in violation of the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act and is illegally offering exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies and offering custodial wallets,” the bank said.

DNB did not specify what it would do if KuCoin continued to operate without a license. Customers of KuCoin and MGL are not in violation of the law, the central bank noted.

KuCoin, which doesn’t have a license in the U.S., operates in over 200 countries and is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide by trading volume, partly because of its low trading fees. The exchange launched in the Netherlands in October 2019.

2022-12-05,"Embattled KuCoin CEO defends high-yield product, hires accountants to verify reserves - Fortune","The current Crypto Winter is littered with the corpses of companies that rose to prominence by offering risky products, from margin trading on FTX to so-called “earn” rewards on Celsius.

In the aftermath of FTX’s bankruptcy, crypto watchers on Twitter set their sights on to KuCoin, the world’s fourth-largest exchange by trading volume. Critics spotted a potential time bomb in the form of KuCoin’s complex options product called “dual investment,” which let customers earn interest rates as high as 300% for depositing cryptocurrencies.

“What is happening on Kucoin?” wrote one popular crypto Twitter account, with a screenshot of the astronomic rates. “Is this a glitch or what?”

The high rates on KuCoin recalled the glory days of now-disgraced platforms like Celsius and BlockFi, where users were promised seemingly impossible returns for holding cryptocurrencies. Those rates, of course, did turn out to be impossible.

emmm

In an interview with Fortune conducted in Mandarin through a translator, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu defended the exchange’s product, arguing that it’s different from other earn products and that KuCoin provides adequate warnings to its users.

If customers use the products after being notified of their risk and then engage in “reckless behavior,” Lyu told Fortune, “the only thing we can express is regret.”

With “dual investment,” users purchase an options contract, meaning they commit to sell or buy a cryptocurrency at a future date for a target price, earning interest in return. The product is non-principal-protected, meaning users may receive less than they initially put in, which explains the high premiums but also the relative risk compared with earn products on other lending platforms.

With the rise of platforms from FTX to Robinhood, retail investors have had increasing access to complicated derivatives products like dual investment, leading to massive losses for inexperienced traders. The volatile nature of crypto, and the dangling of high yields, only heightens the danger.

Lyu said the only responsibility of a platform like KuCoin is to lay out the possible risks to its users, which it does by labeling dual investment with an “advanced” tag and including an FAQ at the bottom of the product page explaining how it works.

Scott Lewis, the co-founder of the decentralized trading platform Slingshot Finance, said that the product is still misleading because it obfuscates prices from users relative to the better rates they could get directly from derivatives markets.

He pointed out that the dual investment product is listed under the “earn” tab on KuCoin’s website, rather than the “derivatives” tab, which he argues is misrepresenting the product. In other words, it is targeting unsophisticated speculators—a reality not solved by an FAQ.

“The disclaimer is not complete until it discloses that the product is a huge ripoff,” Lewis told Fortune.

The dynamic is certainly not limited to KuCoin, with Binance also offering a dual investment product with similar interest rates. That did not stop Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, from tweeting that users should beware of platforms that “offer high APYs,” which many took to be a dig at KuCoin. After users pointed out that Binance has similar products, CZ deleted the tweet.

(Lyu told Fortune that the tweet was not about KuCoin because the exchange offers APRs instead of APYs, although the only major difference is that interest compounds with APYs.)

The flare-up over KuCoin’s dual investment product also came with concerns over solvency, with Lyu releasing an open letter dispelling the rumors and promising to release a Merkle tree proof of reserves. On Monday, the exchange also announced that it was engaging with the accounting firm Mazars to provide a third-party “factual findings” report.

Many in the crypto industry have said that a proof of reserves release is not sufficient without an accounting of liabilities and a third-party audit. KuCoin’s announcement about Mazars only said that it would provide additional transparency and reporting on whether customers’ “in-scope assets are collateralized.” It is unclear if this process will constitute a full third-party audit.

I'm sorry but no. This is not PoR. This is either ignorance or intentional misrepresentation.



The merkle tree is just hand wavey bullshit without an auditor to make sure you didn't include accounts with negative balances. The statement of assets is pointless without liabilities. https://t.co/b5KSr2XKLB — Jesse Powell (@jespow) November 25, 2022

In his interview with Fortune, Lyu said that KuCoin would be releasing a proof of liabilities, although he did not provide a timeline, saying that it would take “more time” to complete the necessary accounting.

On Nov. 29, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter to KuCoin and other major exchanges, requesting information including the firms’ balance sheets and their policies in the event of a crisis such as bankruptcy.

Lyu told Fortune that KuCoin is still waiting to confirm with its legal team that it received the query, but did not commit to providing the information, saying that KuCoin is incorporated in Seychelles, not the U.S. Instead, Lyu said that KuCoin is focusing on releasing its Merkle tree proof of reserves.

“All the efforts that we’re making right now are non-related to any specific country, or requirements and queries from a certain country,” he told Fortune. “This is what we believe is reasonable and correct.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vY3J5cHRvLzIwMjIvMTIvMDUva3Vjb2luLWNlby1kZWZlbmRzLWhpZ2gteWllbGQtbWF6YXJzL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vY3J5cHRvLzIwMjIvMTIvMDUva3Vjb2luLWNlby1kZWZlbmRzLWhpZ2gteWllbGQtbWF6YXJzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-10,KuCoin CEO officially denies rumours of exchange being 'insolvent' - Finbold - Finance in Bold,"As the sell-off in the cryptocurrency market continues, sparked by the FTX liquidity crisis spilling over to other participants in the sector, the CEO of KuCoin decided to publicly address the allegations that his trading platform was struggling with insolvency.

Indeed, KuCoin’s CEO Johnny Lyu criticized the recent ‘FUD’ (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) around his crypto exchange which, as he said, was “probably the tenth time in the past 6 months some rumor on Twitter circulates that KuCoin is ‘insolvent,’” in his blog post published on November 9.

Specifically, after crypto analytics platform Nansen published its exchange stablecoin outflow chart, which, according to Lyu, mistakingly showed an ERC20 to TRC20 translation as $300 million draining from his platform, rumors started circulating about KuCoin being in trouble.

Misunderstood data

As he explained, the information was a simple misinterpretation which has been cleared in the meantime:

“We went to great lengths to clarify with Nansen that it was mainly a currency translation from ERC20 USDT to TRC20 USDT. (…) Nansen acknowledged that they only track ERC20 tokens, so the TRC20 USDT did not show up and was mistakenly interpreted as an outflow.”

To drive his point home, Lyu posted Tronscan and Etherscan explorer screenshots and links to transaction details that support his argument. Notably, the Tronscan screenshot shows the relevant TRC-20 USDT inflow transaction to “KuCoin-Cold” crypto wallet:

At the same time, the Etherscan screenshot demonstrates the recorded ERC-20 USDT outflow transaction from the crypto exchange’s “KuCoin 6” address:

Meanwhile, Nansen’s CEO, Alex Svanevik, posted an explanation of the matter as well, confirming that the “outflow you’re seeing on KuCoin comes from a single $300m USDT network swap to Tron.”

Dedication to transparency

Finally, Lyu promised users that “just like in the past, we would never misappropriate user funds and we will ensure full transparency,” adding that:

“KuCoin will always guarantee 1:1 withdrawal. (…) To those who are still concerned, we will release our Merkle tree proof-of-reserves or POF in one month.”

This announcement is in line with the platform’s reputation as ‘the People’s Exchange’ and the stance of its fellow exchanges Binance and OKX, which both stressed the necessity of carrying out the Proof of funds (POF) and also promised to publish theirs soon.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYm9sZC5jb20va3Vjb2luLWNlby1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWRlbmllcy1ydW1vdXJzLW9mLWV4Y2hhbmdlLWJlaW5nLWluc29sdmVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-05,KuCoin announces third-party PoR verification procedures - CryptoSlate,"KuCoin, the cryptocurrency exchange recently interviewed on the SlateCast, has announced that it will be engaging with the international audit, tax, and advisory firm, the Mazars Group (MG).

MG will provide a third-party factual findings report that KuCoin’s existing and prospective customers can review for additional transparency, and to assess the collateralization of in-scope assets held by the exchange. The MG report will also provide Proof of Reserves (PoR) and customer liability.

The CEO of KuCoin, Johnny Lyu, commented on this latest update:

“As the People’s Exchange, we place the safety and security of our users’ funds as our topmost priority. Working with Mazars is the next step in our efforts to increase asset visibility for our users, highlighting our commitment to transparency and strengthening industry trust. KuCoin has been committed to providing users with safe, easy-to-use platforms and products since day one, while making continuous progress in user protection, transparency, and risk management. It is a great pleasure to engage with Mazars, a leading audit, tax and advisory firm, to provide users with a reliable, credible platform during a time of turbulence and to promote the development of the industry.”

Partner and Digital Lead at Mazars, Wiehann Olivier, said “following recent events, there is a dire need in the industry for additional transparency.”

“We are confident that Mazars’ PoR service offering to KuCoin and other international cryptocurrency exchanges will aid in building trust through transparency.”

Customers will be able to find the published report on the official KuCoin website in a few weeks’ time.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL2t1Y29pbi1hbm5vdW5jZXMtdGhpcmQtcGFydHktcG9yLXZlcmlmaWNhdGlvbi1wcm9jZWR1cmVzL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL2t1Y29pbi1hbm5vdW5jZXMtdGhpcmQtcGFydHktcG9yLXZlcmlmaWNhdGlvbi1wcm9jZWR1cmVzLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-01,KuCoin Wallet Announced the Launch of Chrome Extension Officially - Business Wire,"VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The KuCoin Wallet, designed to be a secure and easy to use crypto wallet that supports multi-chain aggregation powered by the KuCoin ecosystem, has officially launched a Chrome Extension with comprehensively improved security technology and architecture, ensuring the security of user assets across multiple dimensions and safeguarding the Web3 experience. As the crypto industry continues to develop and user demand becomes more and more diverse, easy-to-adopt wallet extensions have become a necessity for all kinds of users. Despite this, past security incidents show that assets are stolen from wallet extensions almost every year, affecting a large number of users and resulting in losses of up to USD 2 Billion in 2022. Safety and easy to use become the main demands for users. Driven by the users demands and the industry reality, KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension is set up to be a safe, reliable and the first wallet with comprehensive Multi-Device Integration.

The First Wallet with Comprehensive Multi-Device Integration

The KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension is a multi-chain wallet based on the Chrome browser that perfectly transplants functionality on mobile devices. In the past, the split management of PC and mobile wallets has led many users to manually import their wallets. After comprehensively understanding users' pain points, KuCoin Wallet has truly realized multi-device collaborative operations without the need to import via secret phrases. Users can scan the QR code to log in to the same account on PC and mobile to enjoy a seamless Web3 DApp experience on either end. Users can manage their wallets through mobile in a unified manner, greatly reducing the potential risks caused by importing critical information such as secret phrases online. KuCoin Wallet solves the historical problem of incompatibility between wallets on PC and mobile in the most efficient manner.

A Revolutionary Solution to the Secret Phrase Storage

Tracing back security incidents related to wallet extension, most of them are related to the separate storage of private keys, secret phrases, and other information on the browser side. As such, the KuCoin Wallet has completely abandoned the traditional solution of storing the secret phrase on the browser in favor of unique storage on the mobile end.

The open nature of the software ecosystems makes PCs more susceptible to malware. In order to reduce the risk of malware attacks, the KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension does not require the import of a secret phrase. Users only need to scan to connect to their PC wallet via WalletConnect to view their assets in real-time. During this process, the PC and mobile wallets are seamlessly connected, and users can log in to their wallets without copying and pasting their secret phrases. KuCoin Wallet avoids the potential risks caused by storing secret phrases on the browser, thereby greatly reducing the risk of leaking secret phrases and maximizing the security of user assets.

Two-Way Encryption Ensures the Security of Assets

KuCoin Wallet users can easily access DApps of various chains on their phones and seamlessly connect to the Web3 network at any time. In addition, the launch of the Chrome Extension allows users to quickly access DApps instead of scanning QR codes one by one to connect to DApps from their PCs.

As a self-custodial wallet, KuCoin Wallet always puts the security of user assets first. Therefore, the KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension adopts the double-encrypted transmission system of WalletConnect for QR scan connections. Before transmitting any message, the body is securely encrypted with AES-256 and transmitted through a WSS-encrypted long-link protocol. WSS and AES-256 double encryption technology ensure that the transmission process and message content cannot be cracked, greatly ensuring the security of user assets.

Mobile authorization completely eliminates the problem of excessive authorization requests

When using the Chrome Extension to interact with DApps, users will receive a confirmation notification on their mobile apps whenever an in-app signature is involved. This ensures users are informed about sensitive wallet operations and protects against the implicit authorization of malicious websites.

Authorization through mobile is a key security function of KuCoin Wallet. All on-chain operations are uniformly authorized through mobile via biometrics or password. This reduces the risk of interception by malware on the PC, providing users with a more convenient and safer experience, and ensuring the protection of assets. Furthermore, using the Chrome Extension, KuCoin Wallet users can safely and conveniently participate in various decentralized projects and freely experience the Web3 world.

Once launched, KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension is supported by many DApps from multiple public chains. Among them, KuCoin Community Chain, as an important component of the KuCoin Web3 ecosystem, has realized deep collaboration with KuCoin Wallet. In addition, convenient access to KuCoin Wallet is supported by many projects on the KCC network, including the leading lending protocol Torches Finance, DEX MojitoSwap, and other single token staking protocols. In the future, KuCoin Wallet will continue to cooperate with KCC in depth.

The head of KuCoin Wallet, Jeff, noted, ""With the increase of users’ demand and the maturity of project development, crypto wallets on PC have become a key portal for users to experience Web3. Their development cannot be ignored. To create a next-generation and secure browser wallet, the KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension eliminates potential security risks, such as the leakage of secret phrases through product design. The wallet realizes multi-device integration and eliminates the storage of secret phrases on the browser side. We believe that a mobile + app design provides a safer and stronger operating environment. We believe that this technical solution will deliver higher security to our users. Security-conscious users can look forward to the launch of a hardware wallet connection solution in the future.”

One-Stop Multi-Chain Asset Management

At present, the KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension supports multi-chain asset management for the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and KCC (KuCoin Community Chain) networks. Users can send, receive, and store tokens such as ETH, USDT, USDC, and BNB.

Users can also view all their NFT assets through the KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension. Whether you are a novice or experienced NFT players, KuCoin Wallet supports quick connection to mainstream NFT markets across multiple chains for storage and trading, single and batch purchases, and more. The KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension is a one-stop platform for purchasing, storing, and displaying NFTs. The wallet’s simplicity and security make it the ideal choice for all kinds of users. Install KuCoin Wallet Extension on your PC now!

By ensuring multi-dimensional security through a variety of technologies, the KuCoin Wallet Chrome Extension provides PC users with a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem experience and secures asset management. Furthermore, it is a milestone in the development of the KuCoin Wallet, laying a foundation for all-around ecosystem expansion. In the future, KuCoin Wallet will offer a greater variety of products and serve as the most secure, convenient, and powerful portal for users to experience Web3!

2022-12-12,"Mazars Releases KuCoin's Verification PoR Report, Concluded That ... - Business Wire","VICTORIA, Seychelles--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global leading audit firm Mazars has released a report about KuCoin’s Proof-of-Reserves to determine the total collateralization ratio of their asset holdings.

Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, commented on this, saying, ""As a people's exchange, we value users' trust in us and commit to ensuring that we contribute in every way to building a culture of transparency in the industry. Our cooperation with Mazars is just one of the measures to ensure we follow through on that commitment to our users. At the same time, KuCoin will continue to explore more ways to better serve our users.""

2022-11-18,The Proof-of-Reserves of the Kucoin exchange - The Cryptonomist,"KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu announces the launch of the Merkle-tree Proof-of-Reserves to regain trust among crypto users after the panic caused by the FTX withdrawal suspension and collapse.

KuCoin: Proof-of-Reserves to restore trust among the crypto community

The episode of the FTX collapse, which also caused cryptocurrency prices to drop by major percentages, has caused crypto-community users to experience total panic.

Not only that, in this 2022, in addition to FTX there have been other major failures such as that of Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, and Alameda Research, a general situation that has led to centralized exchanges losing people’s trust.

And in fact, now more than ever, all centralized exchanges are taking steps to somehow restore confidence in the industry, each devising new solutions that will provide protection for users’ funds.

Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, announced that Merkle’s tree-based Proof-of-Reserves will be launched in a month. On that subject, here is what he said on Twitter:

1/ Protecting user funds is the top priority at KuCoin. We will release Merkle tree proof-of-reserves or POF in about one month. — Johnny_KuCoin (@lyu_johnny) November 9, 2022

“I’d like to give my sympathy for anyone who has been hurt by the current FTX situation. Hopefully, everything can be resolved quickly and the industry can get back on track. Protecting user funds is the top priority at KuCoin. We will release Merkle tree proof-of-reserves or POF in about one month and work closely with authoritative auditing institutions to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness of the numbers and information we provide to our users and to build confidence and transparency in the industry.”

In practice, Lyu said that Proof-of-Reserves is a direct reaction to the panic of users being locked out of their funds, with several exchanges suspending withdrawals. Not only that, KuCoin’s Proof-of-Reserves will use a Merkle tree as proof of verifiable funds.

Proof-of-Reserves is a standard that provides concrete proof of ownership of declared reserves. As early as 2019, Blockstream released a dedicated tool, compatible with several exchanges, so that centralization would also be lacking in the declaration of its reserves.

KuCoin and its report on soccer fans investing in cryptocurrencies

And while there is general panic, there is also a lot of excitement, especially for those crypto users-investors who also love soccer, in view of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

In this regard, the KuCoin exchange published a report “When Crypto Meets Football”, to describe how cryptocurrency investors are also lovers of sports, especially soccer, and how they will act under a crypto and Web3 perspective.

Football excitement surges as the #FIFAWorldCup is around the corner! Read the new insights from KuCoin Research’s “When Crypto Meets Football."" — KUCOIN (@kucoincom) November 18, 2022

“Football excitement surges as the #FIFAWorldCup is around the corner! Read the new insights from KuCoin Research’s “When Crypto Meets Football.”

Overall, the report is based on surveys conducted among 20,180 cryptocurrency investors between January and September 2022 and 8,022 users in KuCoin communities in November 2022.

Highlights of the survey reveal the following points:

70% of cryptocurrency investors are following the 2022 FIFA World Cup;

48% of soccer fans among these cryptocurrency investors are interested in trading fan tokens for sports teams during the upcoming FIFA World Cup;

35% of soccer fans among these cryptocurrency investors have traded NFTs in the past 6 months, and 42% of them are interested in investing in sports NFTs.

The collaboration with Polygon and Web3 companies for “Shoot to Win Goal”

KuCoin also announced that it is collaborating with Polygon and other Web3 companies such as WinGoal and YGG SEA to launch “Shoot to Win Goal”, a 4-day event that aims to highlight the intersection of crypto and soccer.

Specifically, WinGoal is a F2P DApp for the World Cup to earn and win more, and YGG SEA is the first subDAO of Yield Guild Games.

The event will feature three rounds of play, from November 17 to 20, 2022, and participants will be able to receive several prizes, including a $1 million prize pool.

Not only that, users will be able to mint their first NFTs, earn BTC and other tokens for free, win swag and merchandise prizes, such as jerseys, shoes or soccer cleats, iPhones, NFTs, such as CryptoPunk, Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Doodles, as well as tickets to the World Cup in Qatar.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvcHJvb2Ytb2YtcmVzZXJ2ZXMta3Vjb2luLWV4Y2hhbmdlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-11-08,KuCoin Outage—KuCoin Crypto Exchange Suffers Temporary Website Outage - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

The KuCoin website experienced a temporary outage

The website is now accessible again, although some users are reporting intermittent errors

Currently, it's unclear what caused the KuCoin outage, as the exchange is yet to release an official statement

The website of the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange suffered a temporary outage, with users complaining on social media about being unable to access KuCoin.

The error message displayed to visitors of KuCoin's website.

Data from Downdetector shows that users began reporting issues with KuCoin’s website at around 2:20 PM UTC+01:00. By 3:30 PM, the number of reports had already decreased significantly.

At the moment, the KuCoin website is accessible again but some users are reporting inconsistent performance with intermittent errors.

So far, the exchange hasn’t addressed the outage on its official Twitter account. However, a KuCoin representative did acknowledge the issues on KuCoin’s official subreddit. A moderator of the official subreddit stated:

“We are well aware of the current error that the users are experiencing on the KuCoin web and app. Our team is already working to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Rest assured that your assets are safe. Please kindly extend your patience.”

There has been some speculation that crypto trading firm Alameda Research withdrew funds it held on KuCoin which were intended for market making activity. Andrew Thurman, the content lead at blockchain analytics platform Nansen, noted on November 7 that KuCoin’s stablecoin balances had decreased by $304 million over a 7-day period. However, it’s unclear at the moment if Alameda is connected to these stablecoin withdrawals.

We should also make it clear that there is no evidence at the moment that the KuCoin outage was in any way connected to these stablecoin outflows. It’s entirely possible that the outage was caused by technical issues, which are not uncommon on cryptocurrency exchanges, especially during periods of higher market volatility.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwOTg4L2t1Y29pbi1vdXRhZ2VrdWNvaW4tY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXN1ZmZlcnMtdGVtcG9yYXJ5LXdlYnNpdGUtb3V0YWdlL9IBbGh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwOTg4L2t1Y29pbi1vdXRhZ2VrdWNvaW4tY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXN1ZmZlcnMtdGVtcG9yYXJ5LXdlYnNpdGUtb3V0YWdlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-09,"OKX, Kucoin say proof of reserves will be ready in a month - Cointelegraph","In the wake of the FTX liquidity crisis, two major crypto exchanges have announced that they will provide Proof of Reserves, also known as Proof of Funds (PoF) within the next month.

ICYMI: For #OKX, transparency, risk management, & consumer protection come first.



We're hiring an auditor & will publish an auditable Merkle POF asap.

OKX had stated that their PoF would be done “in the coming weeks (within 30 days).” This timeline has now been updated to “asap.”

It's critical for all major crypto venues to publicly share their auditable merkle tree proof-of-reserves or POF.



We plan to publish ours in the coming weeks (within 30 days). This is an important step to establish a baseline trust in the industry.



More to come... — OKX (@okx) November 8, 2022

CEO of KuCoin Johnny Lyu also announced that KuCoin will be providing Proof of Reserves “in about one month.” He said KuCoin will be working with “authoritative auditing institutions” to make sure that the Proof of Funds accurately represents the assets on hand.

I'd like to give my sympathy for anyone who has been hurt by the current FTX situation. Hopefully, everything can be resolved quickly and the industry can get back on track. — Johnny_KuCoin (@lyu_johnny) November 9, 2022

Proof of Reserves is a technique used by some crypto exchanges to provide proof that they have enough assets to handle all withdrawals. A reputable third-party auditor records all customer balances and converts them into a cryptographic Merkle Tree. This anonymizes the data to protect privacy, but it also allows users to compare the total balances held by customers with the total assets the exchange has on hand.

Similar protocols are used by Kraken, Bitmex, Gate.io and many other exchanges, but were not used by FTX. CZ of Binance recently argued that all exchanges should provide PoFs to make sure that an exchange is not using “fractional reserves.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9va3gta3Vjb2luLXNheS1wcm9vZi1vZi1yZXNlcnZlcy13aWxsLWJlLXJlYWR5LWluLWEtbW9udGjSAVxodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3Mvb2t4LWt1Y29pbi1zYXktcHJvb2Ytb2YtcmVzZXJ2ZXMtd2lsbC1iZS1yZWFkeS1pbi1hLW1vbnRoL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

KuCoin Ratings & Reviews

As the most popular centralized cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin has over 20 million users and over $1.2 trillion in trading volume. KuCoin offers one of the largest listings of cryptocurrencies and provides some of the lowest fees across competing exchanges. Between the powerful trading platform, passive income opportunities, and platform rewards, KuCoin has established a wealth of tools needed to make the most out of crypto.

KuCoin Website (Source: https://www.kucoin.com/about-us)

Pros & Highlights

KuCoin boasts several enticing advantages that add to the allure and experience of its platform. KuCoin supports over 700 tokens, including many altcoins not found on other leading exchanges.

In addition to the desktop website, KuCoin is readily accessible through a user-friendly, highly-rated mobile application available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store .

KuCoin does not require KYC verification, but doing so will unlock additional benefits for the traders.

As a cryptocurrency exchange primarily focused on experienced traders, KuCoin offers advanced trading tools such as spot, margin, and futures trading and access to quantitative trading bots.

KuCoin also provides users additional opportunities to earn yields on their crypto, such as the Crypto Lending and KuCoin Earn features.

The platform native token, KuCoin Shares (KCS), offers additional platform benefits to holders, including trading fee discounts and daily dividends.

Cons & Risks

Although KuCoin provides some powerful tools and offerings, there are some downsides to the platform that are important to note. KuCoin is not beginner-friendly. Using the platform requires a basic knowledge of trading tools to buy and sell crypto safely. However, they have recently introduced a more intuitive ‘Convert’ feature that makes this process much easier.

KuCoin offers fiat on-ramps such as bank card linking for users to deposit money, but it is not as smooth as advertised and may not be a viable option for some users. Many KuCoin users look to deposit their assets on other exchanges and send stablecoins, or tokens pegged 1:1 to fiat currency, to their KuCoin account for trading.

KuCoin is available in over 200 countries, but unfortunately, the United States is not one of them. Although US-based users can still utilize the platform, they cannot complete the KYC verification process that unlocks additional benefits.

Other cons of the platform include poor customer support, KYC required to increase daily withdrawal and trading limits, and a limited offering of educational resources.

KuCoin Features

KuCoin has succeeded as a cryptocurrency exchange due to its extensive offering of features throughout its platform. Fiat On-Ramp Options: KuCoin provides multiple options for users to deposit fiat currency onto their platform. Users can deposit assets through credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, ACH transfers, and wire transfers. Advanced Trading Tools: The KuCoin trading interface is comprehensive. The spot, margin, and futures trading capabilities are powerful enough for experienced traders, while the intuitive Convert feature and mobile application make trading easy for beginners. KuCoin Shares Token (KCS): The KuCoin native KuCoin Shares token (KCS) was introduced to provide additional incentives to platform users. Those that hold at least 6 KCS are eligible to earn 50 percent of the platform trading fees as a daily dividend. Holders are also granted trading fee discounts of up to 20 percent. Yield Generating Strategies: Trading cryptocurrencies is not the only way to financially capitalize on the platform, as KuCoin has several features that investors can utilize to capture additional yield on their cryptos, such as staking, lending, and mining capabilities. KuCoin Wallet: In order to bolster the KuCoin ecosystem and platform offerings, KuCoin designed the KuCoin Wallet for users to manage their digital assets. With a multi-chain aggregated token display, NFT storage, and Hacken audited security infrastructure, the KuCoin Wallet offers a viable solution to the self-custody of digital assets.

KuCoin Prices & Withdrawal Fees

KuCoin offers some of the lowest fees in the ecosystem, giving it a major advantage over other centralized exchanges. Trading fees on the platform are structured such that the fee amount decreases as an individual’s trading volume increases. It is also important to note that fees paid via the Kucoin Shares (KCS) token receive a 20 percent discount.

KuCoin Trading Fee Structure (Source: https://www.kucoin.com/vip/level)

The trading fee level of an individual is determined by either the amount of KCS held in the last 30 days, total spot trading volume (in BTC) in the last 30 days, or total futures trading volume (in BTC) in the last 30 days. For example, a user who conducted over 50 BTC in trading volume in the last month will have level one trading fees, equating to a 0.09 percent maker (seller) and 0.1 percent taker (buyer) fee. If those fees are paid in KCS, the fees will be reduced to 0.072 percent maker and 0.08 percent taker fees. KuCoin also charges a fee when tokens are withdrawn from the platform. Withdrawal fees vary from token to token, some requiring fixed rates regardless of transaction size and others charging variable rates.

Company Background & History

When KuCoin co-founder Michael Gan started mining bitcoin at the age of 16, he realized the pitfalls of the cryptocurrency exchange experience when transacting on one of the only exchanges available in 2012, the infamous Mt. Gox.1 As blockchain capabilities continued to develop, Michael Gan partnered with Eric Don in 2013 to begin ideating on the next great exchange when they “realized that [blockchain] was reshaping the financial system into one that would not only serve the richest few but everyone in the world”. Headquartered in Seychelles, KuCoin officially launched in 2017 and has since expanded its presence across the globe, with availability in over 200 countries and 20 million users. Although the platform has already experienced success, the KuCoin team continues to deliver innovative features and add to its extensive token offerings list.

Trader Tools & Trading Experience

The trader tools offered by KuCoin are comprehensive and are tailored more towards experienced investors, providing access to spot trading, margin trading, and futures trading. The desktop trading interface may seem extreme at first glance but is fairly simple to understand after a bit of navigation. Many users may find familiarity with the charting capabilities as they are directly imported from the popular charting platform, TradingView. The mobile-application trading interface is a simplified version of the desktop platform and is much friendlier for beginners. It also delivers an almost gamified experience with offers, rewards, and bonuses exclusive to the app.

KuCoin Trading Interface (Source: https://www.kucoin.com/trade/BTC-USDT)

KuCoin also provides traders the ability to utilize trading bots that automatically execute specific strategies. Users can select from a list of popular trading bots and strategies, or they can implement strategies designed themselves. For the beginner trader, KuCoin has introduced the ‘Convert’ feature, which provides a more intuitive trading experience similar to interfaces seen in DeFi exchanges.

KuCoin Convert Trading Feature (Source: https://www.kucoin.com/convert)

Beyond the advanced trading tools on the platform, KuCoin’s Crypto Lending feature provides users the opportunity to lend their crypto to other users at specific term lengths. With annualized returns of up to 10 percent, this feature can provide users additional yield for crypto otherwise sitting idly in their account.

KuCoin Crypto Lending Interface (Source: https://www.kucoin.com/margin/lend)

KuCoin Earn is a feature unique to KuCoin and is referred to by the team as “a one-stop-shop wealth management service platform”. Through this service, users can subscribe to a variety of different yield-generating strategies across multiple chains and assets. For those interested in Proof of Work (PoW) crypto mining, KuCoin Pool offers a low-fee mining pool that miners can join to secure the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) networks, earning a yield in the process. The KuCoin Pool website provides more information about the required equipment and account setup.

What Cryptocurrencies are Available on KuCoin?

KuCoin provides one of the largest offerings of cryptocurrencies, with over 700 tokens listed on the exchange. These tokens include the majority of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as many altcoins and small-cap tokens that are unavailable on other popular exchanges. The sizable offering of these altcoins is one of the primary reasons that traders choose KuCoin over their competitors, as in many cases, these tokens are listed exclusively on the KuCoin platform.

Security: Is KuCoin Safe & Secure?

Security consideration is the main priority for cryptocurrency investors and exchanges. KuCoin offers a number of security features that help ensure the safety of users’ funds. The implementation of Google’s two-factor authentication and trading/withdrawal safety phrases ensures that only an individual with specific information and devices can access a user’s account, reducing the possibility of a security breach. User funds are custodied by OnChain Custodian and are backed by Lockton Insurance. These partnerships have been established to increase custodial security and provide financial relief to customers in the event of a hack. A portion of platform funds is also stored offline in a cold storage wallet. KuCoin has introduced further security measures by launching a bug bounty program in which participants are awarded up to $10,000 for finding potential weak points in KuCoin’s security. It is important to note that KuCoin was hacked in September 2020, resulting in a loss of almost $285 million. About $240 million of the stolen funds were recovered, and the difference was covered by KuCoin to users.2 This is a major security breach that has led to heavy investment in security infrastructure to ensure the safety of users’ funds. Since this incident, KuCoin has operated with no major security breaches.

Customer Support: Contacts & How to Get Help

The customer support process on the platform can sometimes be a little inefficient. KuCoin claims 24/7 coverage for customer support, but all communications are conducted via support request submittals and email. Currently, users cannot speak with an actual individual regarding complaints, as they do not have phone support. Customer support can be reached by email at tech-support@kucoin.com, or a support request can be submitted on the website.

KYC, Taxes & IRS Reporting Details

Many cryptocurrency exchanges, especially those operating in the United States, require the completion of Know Your Customer (KYC) verification to begin trading. KuCoin does not require KYC verification to use the platform, but completing the verification process significantly increases daily withdrawal and trading limits and unlocks access to leverage trading. Level one KYC users are limited to withdrawals of 1 BTC every 24 hours and up to 20x leverage, whereas level two KYC users have withdrawal limits of up to 200 BTC every 24 hours and up to 100x leverage. The level one KYC verification process consists of providing your name, country of residence, and an ID number from official identification such as a driver’s license or passport. Level two KYC requires users to upload a photo of their official identification and a photo of the user themselves. KuCoin also provides a tutorial video describing the exact steps in detail, with the whole process taking several business days to complete.3 KuCoin does not support KYC verification in the United States. US-based users can still use the platform without KYC, but the experience may be limited. KuCoin does not report to the IRS and is, therefore, not required to generate the respective tax forms. Although KuCoin does not provide tax documents directly, they have partnered with Koinly to generate the needed tax information. This is achieved by exporting KuCoin transaction history directly to Koinly via CSV files or using the KuCoin API.

2022-11-22,Kucoin On The Spot For Holding Nearly One-Fifth Of Its Reserves In Its KCS Token - ZyCrypto,"Advertisement

In the mad rush to calm worried investors and prevent bank runs following the sudden collapse of FTX, crypto exchanges and lending firms have been publishing their proof-of-reserves. The process, which entails confirming an entity’s assets at hand, has exposed glaring issues eliciting mixed reactions in the crypto community.

On November 9, KuCoin became one of the firms to declare that they would release Merkle tree proof-of-reserves “POF” in a month and work closely with auditing institutions to build confidence and transparency in the industry. However, days after making the announcement, the crypto community is now afraid that the exchange’s reserve allocation is somewhat similar to what led to FTX’s collapse.

On Monday, The Block Research, a platform that shares leading research and analysis on the digital asset industry, wrote;

“KuCoin holds nearly one-fifth of its reserves in KCS, its own exchange token. Should this percentage start growing rapidly, it may become a cause for concern, just like how the illiquid FTT formed the bulk of FTX’s balance sheet.”

According to a chart provided by the firm, Kucoin’s holdings are dominated by USDT at 28.96% while its native coin, KCS comes in third at 18.83%. Notably, second in position is a combination of coins marked “others”, which logically suggests KCS could actually be the second largest token holding for the exchange.

And while there is nothing untoward about Kucoin holding such a vast amount of KSC, FTX’s collapse shows that it is a bad idea for exchanges to sit on vast stashes of their tokens. Moreover, the collapse also shows the danger of a rival exchange holding a considerable sum of another exchange’s tokens.

As ZyCrypto reported, FTX’s sudden collapse was partially caused by concerns over the exchange’s FTT token after it was established that the highly illiquid tokens dominated Alameda Research’s balance sheet.

As of June 30, Alameda held $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT”, with $2.16 billion of that amount being used as collateral. A November 6 tweet by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao that they would liquidate any remaining FTT on Binance books ignited a dumping frenzy on FTT plunging the token by over 94%.

Exchange tokens also face what is known as “counterparty risk.” This term is used in crypto when the issuers claim that real-world assets like stablecoins back their exchanges tokens. In the event investors exchange their BTC or ETH for those tokens and liquidity dries up, plunging the exchange token value, those investors have no way to reclaim their BTC or ETH.

However, Johnny Lyu Kucoin’s CEO recently said that KuCoin’s financials are up to scratch, dispelling any FUD targeting the exchange.

“Since its launch in 2017, KuCoin has always adhered to long-term growth and risk-free business strategy. This helped us go through bear cycles and market turbulence, and continue growth,” he tweeted.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8venljcnlwdG8uY29tL2t1Y29pbi1vbi10aGUtc3BvdC1mb3ItaG9sZGluZy1uZWFybHktb25lLWZpZnRoLW9mLWl0cy1yZXNlcnZlcy1pbi1pdHMta2NzLXRva2VuL9IBamh0dHBzOi8venljcnlwdG8uY29tL2t1Y29pbi1vbi10aGUtc3BvdC1mb3ItaG9sZGluZy1uZWFybHktb25lLWZpZnRoLW9mLWl0cy1yZXNlcnZlcy1pbi1pdHMta2NzLXRva2VuLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-11-09,KuCoin banks on glocal strategies to tap into Indian crypto market - YourStory,"Crypto exchange ﻿KuCoin﻿’s recent report titled ‘Into the cryptoverse India’ reveals that its users are from Southeast Asian countries, particularly from India. Over 5.6 million new users are from the country.

In a conversation with The Decrypting Story, Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, talks about the Southeast Asian market and KuCoin’s strategies for emerging economies, including India.

According to Johnny, Southeast Asia has “an attractive Web3 talent pool and is one of the fastest-growing markets in the blockchain space."" “These markets are utilising technology to create tools and businesses that address complex issues,” he says.

Besides Southeast Asia, KuCoin has also seen an influx in its user base from Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and Europe. “Africa has seen good adoption in terms of crypto,” says KuCoin’s CEO.

Strategies for emerging markets

Johnny believes that understanding the needs of different regions, their financial infrastructure, cultural differences, and trading preferences is critical for the firm. Hence, it is adopting strategies to focus on these areas.

“Trading communities are more active in emerging markets than in developed markets, and cryptocurrencies are widely used in these developing economies. Projects in emerging markets would fare better when they are targeted at local traders,” says Johnny.

Johnny says that, despite greater crypto adoption, users in emerging markets lack the necessary tools, infrastructure, and financial access to engage in crypto trading.

The exchange intends to provide infrastructure tools to help users in these markets. It currently offers a trading bot that allows users to set certain conditions in which the bot will execute trade.

“Our KuCoin trading bot is free-to-use software that traders can use to automate their crypto trading. We have examples of several users having earned a stable source of passive income in these countries by using the KuCoin trading bot at absolutely no cost,” says Johnny.

According to him, glocal strategy will be one of the company’s focus areas. “Hiring local employees to serve local customers could help accelerate this strategy,” he says.

In addition to its glocal strategy, the firm is also invested in education of users. To help drive safe crypto trading practices, KuCoin has launched a #ThinkBeforeYouInvest campaign. “That is aimed at sharing some basic level information for our users to gain more understanding of investor protection related queries,” says Johnny.

KuCoin bets big on India

KuCoin’s CEO views India as one of the key markets and says that a sizeable portion of its users are Indians. Hence, the exchange is extending support to Indian startups.

Earlier this year, KuCoin launched a $50-million support plan to aid the development of the Indian blockchain industry.

“We have built local communities across India, hired locals, and we are actively collaborating with regional crypto firms like Bitbns, on various projects. India clearly has a huge potential to lead the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries as a market that is rapidly expanding.”

To strengthen the Indian Web3 ecosystem, the firm intends to finance initiatives such as incubation, hackathons, and consultation.

On the future potential of the Indian market, Johnny says, “The rise of venture capital investments and distributed ledger technology will be the key market growth drivers. Therefore, for continued growth, exchanges and crypto lenders should focus on user satisfaction, as the adoption of cryptocurrencies depends on the core principles of transparency and accountability.”

Johnny observes a trend that is unique to India. He points out that on-chain crypto activity is higher in India and crypto popularity has been rising in the country. “The shift in outlook among users towards investing in crypto can be seen.”

According to KuCoin’s report, 59% of Indian crypto users are aware of the investment products that suit them and 63% of users are aware of how to manage risks in their portfolio.

Future play

KuCoin is currently ranked fifth on CoinMarketCap’s ranking of crypto exchanges, trailing behind ﻿Binance﻿, ﻿Coinbase﻿, ﻿FTX﻿, and ﻿Kraken﻿. The Singapore-based crypto exchange reached 10 million users in December. It records a daily transaction volume of over $3 billion, according to data by CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.

Although Coinbase, FTX, and Binnace are frequently in the news, Johnny does not see them as competition because the exchange, he says, is concentrating on its user base rather on other exchanges.

“We have our differentiation and specific user groups. As one of the most emerging and developing industries, the crypto market is very diverse and extensive. Although there will inevitably be some competitiveness between each other, I think the most important thing is that each of us contribute to this growing industry through our own efforts and provide value to customers with the belief of accelerating the development of crypto, building consensus, and ultimately pushing crypto investments from geeks to the masses,” he says.

Johnny admits that creating a secure trading exchange has its set of challenges and the only way to overcome them is to work harder.

“We are working towards building an equal and safe trading market in the challenging geopolitical atmosphere of today, paying little attention to where we stand in ratings and listings. We now have to work even harder. Our crypto experts are putting together a flexible strategy that takes into account the present situation (the current bear market) and will enable us to move forward and maintain our reputation as a people’s exchange, in light of the fact that the operational environment and related regulations are changing every day,” he says.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS90aGUtZGVjcnlwdGluZy1zdG9yeS9rdWNvaW4tam9obm55LWx5dS1iZXRzLWJpZy1pbmRpYS1nbG9jYWwtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy13ZWIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The FIFA World Cup is around the corner, and it is one of the most significant sports events in the world, uniting football fans globally. This year, the event is headed to the Middle East for the first time in history. However, the 2022 FIFA World Cup will also be a first for several other reasons, especially the way crypto features in it.

The Intersection of Crypto and Football

Since the last major bull run in the crypto market, we have seen the sports industry adopt cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based solutions with open arms. The love for crypto in sports remains strong even when the global market goes through periods of bearishness. According to the survey, football is the most popular sport among crypto investors. 24 percent of crypto investors say that football is their favorite sport. ""Community"" (41%), ""Teamwork"" (33%), and ""Passion"" (30%) are considered the top values shared among crypto and football, followed by ""Strategic"" (27%), and ""Accessibility to All"" (23%).

Where The Crypto Football Fans Are

Football is the most universal sport, attracting the interest of fans around the world. According to FIFA, there are 5 billion football fans around the world, with Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa representing the largest fan bases.

KuCoin analyzed it from another angle — the intersection of crypto and the football fan base. Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia are regions where passions for crypto and football cross paths. France, Spain, Vietnam, Germany, and Brazil feature the largest share of football fans among crypto investors. 4 out of every 10 crypto investors in these countries identify themselves as football fans.

Football Fans Engagement in Web3

With football being the most popular sport among crypto investors, it is no surprise that the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League are at the top of the list of sports events to watch. According to the KuCoin survey, 70% of crypto investors are planning to watch the 2022 FIFA World Cup, making it the sporting event most looked forward to among crypto communities.

Fandom and community based on shared visions and passions are the core elements holding both worlds of crypto and football together, and the upcoming FIFA World Cup will be a wild celebration of them. 48% of football fans among crypto investors are interested in trading fan tokens during the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup. The ownership of fan tokens could serve several purposes: establishing membership in the community, empowering them with voting rights on topics related to the team or club they support, enjoying VIP access to exclusive merchandise and rewards, and more. The event is also expected to drive popularity for other sports tokens. 28% of football fans among crypto investors are interested in investing in general sports tokens or projects, including some of the most popular, trending ones, such as Sweatcoin, Chiliz, Stepn, Alpine, and Flow, which are available on KuCoin.

In addition to fan tokens, sports NFTs are another way for football fans to engage with their favorite teams, players, and events in the world of Web3. The survey revealed that football fans are more engaged in trading sports-related NFTs compared to average crypto investors. 35% of football fans among crypto investors claim to have traded NFTs over the past 6 months, while only 13% of average crypto investors have done so.

42% of football fans among crypto investors are interested in investing in sports NFTs. Sports NFTs are most popular in France, Turkey, Brazil, Spain, and the United States. More than a third of crypto investors in these countries are interested in investing in sports NFTs.

2022-12-16,"Auditor Mazars Pauses All Work For Binance, Other Crypto Clients - Investopedia","Mazars Group, an accounting firm, stopped vouching for assets that crypto firms hold in reserve, less than two weeks after saying that Binance was over-collateralized in a report that's no longer on the company's website.



Key Takeways Mazars Group suspended all work with its crypto clients, including Binance, KuCoin, and Crypto.com.

Earlier this month, the accounting firm released proof-of-reserve reports for the crypto exchanges.

According to Mazars, the proof-of-reserves reports it has published so far have not been sufficient to assure markets. The reports are no longer available on the website.



Proof-Of-Reserve Is Not Sufficient

Earlier this month, the auditor found that KuCoin's crypto assets reserves were all overcollateralized. Similarly, it reported that Crypto.com's reserves are fully backed 1:1. The reports are also no longer available on Mazar's website.

According to Mazars, the proof-of-reserves reports it has published so far have not been sufficient to assure markets. A proof-of-reserve allows centralized exchanges to publicly prove their solvency and attest to the value of their reserves.

An email from the firm described intense media scrutiny as another concern. A Mazar's spokesperson said the suspension was limited to its provision of proof-of-reserves reports, citing “concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public.”

It has been argued that proof-of-reserves reports are not comparable to a full audit because they are limited to showing assets and not liabilities and instead serve as snapshots that check out client information.



Challenging Time For Crypto Firms

Mazars’ decision is a setback for an industry that’s been trying to bolster its credibility in the wake of several bankruptcies and the spectacular collapse of FTX. Cryptocurrency exchanges are proving their solvency and demonstrating they have adequate funds for customer withdrawals. The CEOs of Binance and Crypto.com are looking to differentiate their business practices from what happened at FTX.



The Bottom Line

Mazars, which earlier this year fired the Trump Organization as a client due to a lack of trustworthiness of financial statements, has now given a new challenge to crypto firms.

As a result of the news, Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the exchange, fell 7.7%, trading around $243. KuCoin's native token, KCS, also dropped a bit, hovering around $6.5, according to CoinMarketCap.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vbWF6YXJzLXN1c3BlbmRzLWNyeXB0by1jbGllbnRzLTY5MzExMDbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-17,Trust Wallet Token and KuCoin are trying to gain a foothold with investors! Snowfall Protocol Explodes In - Bitcoinist,"New cryptocurrencies are constantly rising to the top and then trying to maintain that position. Some new coins are also appearing frequently. While many can be labelled as a short-term flash in the pans, some have real promise for delivering strength to any portfolio. The main coin being Snowfall Protocol – it has increased over 500% already and is still only in stage 2 of its presale!!

Today we will examine three coins that are at the top and recommend which one should be added to all growth portfolios. While Trust Wallet Token (TWT) and KuCoin (KCS) are good options for short-term investments, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) offers unique features for safe and growth-based investment.

Trust Wallet Token (TWT)

Trust Wallet Token (TWT) was launched on Binance in early 2021. It intended to act with the Trust Wallet network to keep Ethereum and other ERC-20 crypto. The TWT acts as a crypto coin or the Trust Wallet app’s native currency. . Trust Wallet Token (TWT) was supposed to act as a rewards system for offering discounts on uses of the Trust Wallet app.

Trust Wallet Token (TWT) suffers from having low features and little to offer to its users. Multiple alternatives provide the same level of security. Most blockchains and decentralized exchanges offer their users their in-house self-custody wallets. Trust Wallet Token wouldn’t be the best buy in my opinion.

KuCoin (KCS)

KuCoin (KCS) is a cryptocurrency designed to work on the Ethereum blockchain. The token was launched to target blockchain growth and innovation. KuCoin (KCS) plans to offer its users decentralized exchange (DEX) services. It acts as the basic token for the DEX.

The cryptography method used by KuCoin (KCS) is designed to protect user details and blockchain transactions from other users. While the stated objectives are all outstanding, there is a little practical demonstration of such value for people using the token. KuCoin again isn’t the best buy right now.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW)

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is in the last stage of its pre-sales activities and has given its early investors over 500% gains. The coin is already trading at $0.030 (while still in pre-sale). Experts believe it will increase by 5,000x by its launch date.

The project’s unique proposition strongly supports this forecast. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) aims to offer users a cross-chain bridge for digital asset transfer. The growth in its price is supported by Snowfall Protocol’s capacity to solve a significant problem in the blockchains efficiently. The lack of interlinkage between blockchains affects decentralized finance activities.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) can support users that want to exchange their assets over any blockchain pair. There is a growing demand for this functionality as it helps investors grow their invested capital across all profitable crypto chains. This means that Snowfall Protocol (SNW) offers a highly demanded utility. Cross-chain transfers allow users to book transactions over different blockchains at low prices and enable smart contracts to shift from one crypto chain to another whenever needed. This lets investors earn better over multiple platforms than staying on a single chain.

This is why most analysts and industry experts are so optimistic about investing in the Snowfall Protocol (SNW).

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is expected to outshine all the presales out there. In fact, experts are predicting it to be the next 1000X token!

2022-11-29,"Senate seeks financial data from Binance, other crypto firms - The Washington Post","Listen 3 min Share Comment on this story Comment

A top Senate Democrat on Tuesday pressed Binance, Coinbase and other major cryptocurrency exchanges to explain how they would protect their customers in the event of a financial calamity, as Washington braces for further fallout from the collapse of FTX. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The new requests for information — sent by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the leader of the tax-focused Senate Finance Committee — arrived as Democrats weighed a battery of new bills and oversight hearings targeting the mostly unregulated crypto industry.

Wyden directed his letters to the U.S. division of Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, Bitfinex and Gemini, major exchanges that allow customers worldwide to buy and sell various digital tokens. The senator asked them to reveal more information about the way they manage customers’ deposits and assets. Wyden also requested the firms’ balance sheets, while demanding they explain their policies in the event of a crisis, such as bankruptcy.

In seeking that data, Wyden pointed to a wide array of federal laws that protect investors in registered securities or customers at regulated banks — but, often, not those who purchase crypto. He cited that discrepancy as he blasted the “outrageous mismanagement” at FTX, which had been the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange until a liquidity crisis plunged it into insolvency this month.

“If these protections had been in place before the failure of FTX,” Wyden stressed, “far fewer retail investors would be facing precipitous financial harm today.”

Wyden’s missives came as the FTX meltdown continued to rattle the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The latest casualty arrived Monday, when BlockFi, a crypto lender tied to FTX, indicated that it had more than 100,000 creditors as it filed for bankruptcy.

The widening fallout drove down the price of bitcoin and other tokens, and it fueled continued scrutiny in Washington, where lawmakers for years had neglected the crypto industry. Over that same period, Democrats and Republicans also amassed increasingly large campaign donations from crypto magnates, including FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his subordinates during the 2022 elections.

Lawmakers now plan to convene several hearings to explore cryptocurrency and the government’s oversight of it. On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture Committee is set to question Rostin Behnam, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Share this article Share

Behnam generally is seen as supportive of the industry. He also has worked alongside the committee’s leaders — Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) — to advance legislation that would expand the power of the CFTC to oversee crypto, an idea advanced by Bankman-Fried personally. In recent days, lawmakers have said they are reevaluating the bill given its ties to FTX.

Two weeks later, the House Financial Services Committee hopes to question the FTX founder directly as well as the company’s rivals, including Binance, at what could be the first of multiple hearings. While Bankman-Fried has not confirmed that he intends to testify, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the outgoing chairwoman of the panel, said the session is meant to ensure that “this never happens again.”

Across the Capitol, Democrats remain torn on the need for new legislation that specifically targets cryptocurrency. In an interview last week, Wyden first promised a “consumer protection” package targeting cryptocurrency, noting he had been working for “months” to rally other lawmakers to support the yet-unreleased bill.

Many senior lawmakers, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the leader of the Senate Banking Committee, have said they believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission already has ample authority to pursue the worst abuses in digital finance. Nevertheless, any attempts to rein in the industry could stall next year, when Republicans are set to inherit the House, potentially paving the way for gridlock in a split-party Capitol.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS91cy1wb2xpY3kvMjAyMi8xMS8yOS9zZW5hdGUtZmluYW5jZS13eWRlbi1iaW5hbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-14,KuCoin token has a new utility Toon Finance coin takes over ... - Tekedia,"KuCoin has revealed that a new utility coin, Toon Finance, will be available for interested investors to trade once the digital token is officially released on January 1. With experts predicting a huge 2023 for the Toon Fi (TFI) coin, it is news that all members of the KuCoin community will be pleased to hear.

It’s a development that will undoubtedly pique the interest of gaming fans looking to fully embrace the P2E community and investors who are focused solely on ROIs alike. Here’s all you need to know about the development before January arrives, as well as the popularity of KuCoin as a thriving system to facilitate transactions.

KuCoin’s growing presence in the crypto universe

KuCoin is a global cryptocurrency exchange that is now used by over one in four cryptocurrency holders. Powered by a personal and private KuCoin Wallet, investors can trade a long list of different crypto coins, including the major players in the digital landscape.

The exchange was designed and developed by two coders, one of whom started coding at the age of 8, and was officially launched in September 2017 with a focus on accessibility for inexperienced crypto traders. This is highlighted by a dedicated beginner’s zone and the 24/7 customer care services that are available in multiple languages. It is primarily used by investors in European markets but has users from around the globe.

Furthermore, the platform has a dedicated section for NFTs while features include spot trading, margin trading, and an automated trading bot. There are also Futures light, classic, and brawl derivatives as well as leveraged tokens. The growth of the platform in a little over five years has been incredible and its user-focused attributes make it an ideal outlet for new investors who are looking to finally join the modern financial landscape.

Toon Finance and the new P2E community

Toon Finance and its native Toon Fi coin have already made a lot of noise in the growing community of gaming investors. In fact, many experts have already pinpointed it as one of the best tokens to hold in 2023 while it is already the most searched coin on CoinMarketCap. The attraction for gamers is clear, which also adds to the appeal for investors motivated solely by money.

The Toon Finance metaverse is one that allows gamers to compete against each other courtesy of the SHA256-encrypted Play2Earn Space Battle Grounds. Additional features include a lottery, trading, and bridging. Aside from an immersive metaverse experience, it offers a fantastic introduction to NFTs.

In addition to the fun digital setting and super secure private transactions, Toon Finance is supported by a clear yet flexible roadmap that covers a presale launch, AMA, marketing litepaper, platform launch, and post-launch elements. The DeFi metaverse’s success, however, will be largely focused on games like Coin & Checkers Battleground, Cards, and other PVP titles.

If Toon Finance continues to penetrate the P2E community by taking blockchain-backed gaming to the next level, its native coin will almost certainly see significant growth.

Why Toon Fi makes great sense for KuCoin

KuCoin has been a particularly popular platform for investors who arguably don’t have a full understanding of how blockchain tech actually works and are fond of meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. TFI combines some of those fun features and high ROI potential while simultaneously unlocking the functionality of utility coins.

TFI has already enjoyed a phenomenal pre-sale since opening this phase of its roadmap in October. Investors can already purchase tokens with ETH but those waiting for greater flexibility can wait for January’s official release thanks to platforms like KuCoin. With a total supply of 1 billion TFI tokens, there will be availability on launch day despite the popularity leading up to it.

However, early investors stand to see the biggest ROIs, which is why many will want to target the pres-sale. Or at the very least, be ready for launch day. If analysts’ predictions do materialise, the new token is unlikely to take as long as DogeCoin or other popular coins to start its bull run.

Similarly, investors who are focused on the financial returns rather than the P2E community can embrace the user-friendly KuCoin platform to make it happen. The exchange platform actively uses advanced technologies and has already recorded $30bn of trades in a single day. When combined with the recent news that KuCoin is also listing AirDAO’s ecosystem, it is an exciting time for members of its growing community,

Using ICOs and early launch investments

Almost every crypto inventor learns about the arena as a result of missing the boat on an asset that rocketed. Whether learning about those assets in insight or spectating without participating, the good news is that there will always be other opportunities around the corner if you are willing to identify them. Perhaps more importantly, the past experiences of cryptos will have taught a valuable lesson: timing is everything.

Cryptocurrencies can see their value change virtually overnight. While even some of the biggest crypto success stories had a long period of stagnation before bull runs, it is evident that the top new tokens have the potential to see their value soar in no time. For investors, ICOs (initial coin offerings), offer a wonderful opportunity to capitalise on new investments before the ship sails. However, it is always important to do research on a project linked to the ICO to avoid potential financial losses.

Aside from potentially getting the lowest price at launch – or even a discounted pre-sale rate – ICOs enable investors to support financial products and crypto companies while they are in the funding phases. Moreover, investors gain the opportunity to build diverse portfolios without making huge investments in any individual token.

For launch investments and research purposes, KuCoin is an ideal platform for investors. As shown with Toon Finance, the exchange is quick to add the hottest tokens and upcoming assets. A thriving community that supports various blockchain ecosystems additionally allows beginners to act with confidence, especially when they find the next big thing in crypto.

2022-12-19,KuCoin loses Mazars and DNB consensus - The Cryptonomist,"KuCoin is being dumped by both Mazars and the Central Bank of the Netherlands, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the latter saying that the company is operating illegally.

The ranking of major crypto exchanges undergoes daily changes and with it, even more sudden are the updates about auditing in the industry.

In the wake of FTX’s collapse that led to losses for millions of users as well as the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried among other repercussions, many cryptocurrency companies ran for cover by hiring auditing firms to verify and certify the collateral of companies.

KuCoin, is currently the third largest crypto exchange and is based in Seychelles, and because of its role and position it is among the companies that have rushed to hire Mazars (a French audit firm).

The transalpine audit had certified that KuCoin had over-collateralized Bitcoin, Ether, USDT and USDC.

The digital gold reserve for the crypto platform was 101% collateralized, stablecoin USDT 102%, USDC 101%, and Ether 100%.

The report had been provided on 26 November and the Proof of Reserve had been approved in full by Mazars.

Mazars leaves the KuCoin exchange

Things in the crypto world change fast and that is how the fear component came back into play and Mazars Group, has “temporarily” suspended relations with its crypto world assistants namely KuCoin, Crypto.com and Binance.

At the microphones of CNBC, Mazars had commented on the decision as follows:

“We have paused its activity related to entity reserve proof reports in the cryptocurrency industry due to concerns regarding how these reports are understood by the public. They are produced in accordance with standards [.. .] but do not constitute a warranty or audit opinion. Instead, they report limited results based on the procedures applied at a given time.”

Bad news typically never comes alone, and so the Central Bank of the Netherlands addressed KuCoin last Thursday.

According to De Nederlandsche Bank, KuCoin was operating illegally stating:

“Cryptocurrency company was illegally offering services and illegally offering custody wallets to customers.”

KuCoin is not sailing in good waters, and meanwhile Binance, also orphaned by Mazars specified that

“Mazars has indicated that the pause with clients from the cryptocurrency sector is temporary.”

On 7 December, the French auditing firm had published a five-page report on Proof of Reserve but it has since been removed from the exchange’s website.

The report only covered the collateral on Bitcoin and not the other credit assets, on this matter Changpeng Zhao pointed out that Binance has no debt whatsoever and that customers’ money is in a one-to-one protection ratio.

CZ to CNBC stated:",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjIvMTIvMTkva3Vjb2luLWxvc2VzLW1hemFycy1kbmIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-30,Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Takes A Subtle Dig At Kraken And KuCoin - Ethereum World News,"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took a jibe at rival crypto exchanges Kraken and KuCoin.

Zhao implied in a tweet that recent announcements made by his rivals were red flags.

Crypto Twitter took issue with CZ’s tweet, which was subsequently deleted.

Kraken announced today that it is laying off 30% of its staff amid the ongoing crypto winter.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao made a rather controversial tweet earlier today. The tweet, which is now deleted, appeared to take a subtle dig at two of Binance’s rival exchanges, Kraken and KuCoin. Zhao recommended people to stay away from platforms that offer a high annual percentage yield (APY) and/or have layoffs.

If you don’t do risk management now, don’t blame others for the consequences later” CZ’s tweet read.

Zhao was likely referring to rival exchanges KuCoin and Kraken. KuCoin became the topic of debate in the crypto community on Twitter earlier this week after users noticed the sky-high APYs being offered by the exchange. Crypto influencers shared screenshots that showed triple-digit returns on KuCoin’s earn program. The exchange’s official website is currently showing a 215% APY on Ethereum(ETH), 268% APY on Bitcoin (BTC) and 100% APY on Tether (USDT).

Kraken, the world’s third-largest exchange by volume, announced earlier today that it was laying off 30% of its staff. According to the exchange, the decision to cut 1,100 people from its global workforce was taken to weather the ongoing crypto winter. CEO Jesse Powell took to Twitter to clarify that the departing employees were given 4 months of severance pay and healthcare coverage.

Changpeng Zhao’s tweet draws criticism

Users on Twitter were quick to call out Zhao’s attempt to indirectly induce FUD about rival exchanges. One user pointed out that CZ’s warnings were ironically applicable on his own platform, given that Binance was offering similar APYs similar to that offered by KuCoin. Binance’s dual investment program is currently offering 123% APY on Bitcoin and 226% on Ethereum.

When confronted by a popular crypto influencer, Changpeng Zhao defended his words, arguing that while layoffs weren’t necessarily a red flag, risk management was still important. He further clarified that his tweet was not meant against Kraken or any other exchange. The controversial tweet was taken down by CZ following criticism from crypto Twitter.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZXRoZXJldW13b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tL2NoYW5ncGVuZy16aGFvLXRha2VzLWEtZGlnLWtyYWtlbi1rdWNvaW4v0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi5ldGhlcmV1bXdvcmxkbmV3cy5jb20vY2hhbmdwZW5nLXpoYW8tdGFrZXMtYS1kaWcta3Jha2VuLWt1Y29pbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-16,"Total crypto market cap takes another hit, but traders remain neutral - Cointelegraph","The total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped 8.1% in the past two days after failing to break the $880 billion resistance on Dec. 14.

The rejection did not invalidate the 4-week-long ascending channel, but a weekly close below $825 billion will confirm a shift to the lower band and reduce the support level to $790 billion.

The overall investor sentiment toward the market remains bearish, and year-to-date losses amount to 66%. Despite this, Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped a mere 2% on the week, down to the $16,800 level at 17:00 UTC on Dec. 16.

A far different scenario emerged for altcoins which are being pressured by pending regulation and fears that major exchanges and miners could be insolvent. This explains why the total market capitalization had dropped by 4.7% since Dec. 9.

According to court documents filed on Dec. 15, a United States Trustee announced the committee responsible for part of FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings. Among those are Wintermute Asia, a leading market maker, and GGC International, an affiliate of the troubled lending platform Genesis. Investors remain in the dark about who the biggest creditors from the failed FTX exchange group are and this is fueling speculation that contagion could continue to spread.

On Dec. 15, The central bank of the Netherlands issued a warning to investors using KuCoin, saying the exchange was operating without legal registration. De Nederlandsche Bank added that the crypto firm was “illegally offering services” and “illegally offering custodian wallets” for users.

Adding to the drama, on Dec. 16, Mazars Group, a company known for its proof-of-reserve audit services for crypto companies, reportedly removed recent documents that detail exchange audits from its website. The firm was previously appointed as an official auditor for Binance’s proof-of-reserve updates, a movement that was followed by KuCoin and Crypto.com.

The Bitcoin mining sector has also suffered due to the strong correction in cryptocurrency prices and rising energy costs. Publicly-listed miner Core Scientific was offered a $72 million contingent emergency credit line to avoid bankruptcy. The financial lender requires suspension of all payments to Core Scientific’s equipment lenders while Bitcoin remains below $18,500.

The 4.7% weekly drop in total market capitalization was impacted mainly by Ether’s (ETH) 5.4% negative price move and BNB (BNB), which traded down 15.1%. Consequently, the bearish sentiment significantly impacted altcoins, with 14 of the top 80 coins dropping 12% or more in the period.

The Open Network (TON) gained 30% after Telegram launched bidding for anonymous phone numbers sold for TON tokens.

Bitcoin SV (BSV) rallied 11.7% after Craig Wright, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto and leader of the altcoin project, appealed to his loss in Norway courts.

Trust Wallet (TWT) saw a 27.2% correction after its parent company (Binance) faced $1.9 billion in withdrawals in 24 hours.

Leverage demand is balanced between bulls and bears

Currently, data shows demand for leverage is split between the bulls and the bears.

Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.

A positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.

Perpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on Dec. 16. Source: Coinglass

The 7-day funding rate was near zero for Bitcoin and altcoins, meaning the data points to a balanced demand between leverage longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) in the period.

Traders should also analyze the options markets to understand whether whales and arbitrage desks have placed higher bets on bullish or bearish strategies.

The options put/call volume reflects a neutral market

Traders can gauge the market’s overall sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.

A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and this is bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options by 40%, which can be deemed bearish.

Even though Bitcoin’s price failed to break the $18,000 resistance on Dec. 14, there was no excessive demand for downside protection using options. More precisely, the indicator has been below 1.00, so slightly optimistic, since Dec. 12.

Presently, the put-to-call volume ratio stands near 0.88 because the options market is more strongly populated by neutral-to-bullish strategies that favor call (buy) options by 12%.

Derivatives markets are neutral, but the newsflow is negative

Despite the substantial weekly price decline in a handful of altcoins and the 4.7% drop in total market capitalization, derivatives metrics reflect no signs of panic.

There has been a balanced demand for longs and shorts using futures contracts. As a result, the BTC options risk assessment metric remains favorable even after Bitcoin’s 8.5% correction following the $18,370 high on Dec. 14.

Ultimately, bulls should not expect the $825 billion market capitalization to hold, which does not necessarily mean an immediate retest of the $790 billion support.

Currently, the lower band of the ascending channel continues to exert upward pressure, but the newsflow looks favorable for bears.

2022-11-09,Crypto exchanges see more withdrawals over fears of FTX liquidity - Forkast News,"Cryptocurrency exchanges are experiencing the largest volume of stablecoin withdrawals in about six months, following FTX’s liquidity crunch that has sent shockwaves throughout the industry and led to Binance’s pledge to acquire the troubled exchange.

The number of stablecoin withdrawal transactions through exchanges grew to 49,070 on Tuesday, the highest since May 12, according to data from on-chain data analytics firm CryptoQuant.

Over 4.2 billion stablecoins moved out of all exchanges on Tuesday, the most since June 15, CrytoQuant data showed.

The outflows occurred as FTX encountered a liquidity crunch on Tuesday, with users unable to withdraw assets. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange that said on Sunday it would sell all its holdings of FTX’s native crypto token FTT, announced on Tuesday that it will bail out FTX by acquiring it.

The series of risk events have triggered withdrawals at a number of major exchanges over the past few days.

In the past seven days, KuCoin saw the largest stablecoin outflows among exchanges, recording US$298.1 million in stablecoins transferred out from the exchange, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen.

FTX saw about US$255.8 million in seven-day stablecoin outflows as of 3 p.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, followed by US$219.5 million at OKX, US$166.1 million at Kraken and US$119.6 million at Huobi, Nansen data showed.

Binance also booked large volumes of withdrawals. On Tuesday, it processed transactions of 1.75 billion stablecoins transferred out of the exchange, marking the largest outflow since Aug. 23, according to CryptoQuant data.

Transparency pledge

To enhance transparency, Changpeng Zhao (commonly known as “CZ”), chief executive officer of Binance, tweeted on early Wednesday in Asia that Binance will start to carry out merkle-tree proof-of-reserves. A merkle tree is a kind of data structure that can be used by blockchains to ensure data integrity, and such merkle-tree proof-of-reserves can prove that the exchange is properly accounting for clients’ crypto assets.

A number of crypto exchanges have pledged to follow suit in conducting and disclosing such documentation.

OKX tweeted on Wednesday that it will publish its merkle-tree proof-of-reserves or proof of funds within 30 days, as it is “an important step to establish a baseline trust in the industry.”

Tron founder Justin Sun, who recently became Huobi’s global advisory board member, said that Huobi had just wrapped up such a procedure about a month ago, but “but we would love to do a third one with CZ’s proposal.”

I want to echo CZ’s advice. @Poloniex and @HuobiGlobal both have done it before. Huobi actually just finished it about one month ago. But we would love to do a third one with CZ’s proposal. Merkle-tree proof-of-reserves 100% is very important to our industry and transparency. https://t.co/v4e09RWxGx — H.E. Justin Sun🌞🇬🇩🇩🇲🔥 (@justinsuntron) November 9, 2022

Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, also tweeted that it will release merkle-tree proof-of-reserves or proof of funds in about one month and work with auditors to build confidence and transparency in the industry.

Justin D’Anethan, institutional sales director of crypto finance firm Amber Group, told Forkast in a Wednesday interview that it would be hard for a crypto trading entity to operate efficiently and disclose its positions and holdings in a transparent manner.

“You do need a certain level of secrecy in order to just [trade] and execute orders in the right way for yourself and for your clients,” D’Anethan said. “So it’s not as easy as saying I want to be transparent and therefore I will be. There’s a trade-off here.”

Antonio Juliano, founder of crypto derivatives exchange dYdX, also questioned that a proof-of-reserves might not disclose all the relevant information of a centralized exchange’s assets.

“How do you know if the entity has outstanding loans? How do you know what contracts they’ve entered into?” Juliano wrote in a Wednesday tweet.

Clara Medalie, research director of crypto data firm Kaiko, told Forkast that Coinbase could be one of the few exchanges that stand to gain from this new behemoth, as it could “leverage its regulated status and transparency of reserves to attract a more institutional client base.”

The decision follows requests from community members to delist the token. In a tweet, influencer Cevo urged Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to immediately take action against FTT, suggesting delisting everything FTX-related to protect the exchanges’ customers.

Apart from Binance, BitMEX has delisted the perpetual swap contracts connected to FTT. This includes its FTT/USD and FTT/USDT pairs. The exchange cited a reduction in spot trading of the pairs as its reason for delisting. Like BitMEX, KuCoin has also delisted its FTT/USDT perpetual contract on KuCoin Futures.

Meanwhile, Zipmex has also announced that it would be delisting FTT on Nov. 22, 2022, but will leave withdrawals open until Feb. 14, 2023.

Days after the beginning of the FTX crisis, its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, tweeted various cryptic messages, attracting wild theories and speculation within the crypto community. Some theorized that the tweets could be an act by Bankman-Fried to potentially make a defense by claiming insanity if he’s ever taken to court.

After the FTX fraud was brought to light, an interview with Bankman-Fried in The New York Times garnered criticisms from Crypto Twitter for seemingly defending the actions of the former FTX CEO.

2022-11-23,Binance Launchpad Is Hosting Token Sale for Web3 Onboarding Project Hooked Protocol (HOOK) - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

Binance Launchpad will be hosting a token sale for Hooked Protocol (HOOK)

Binance will be recording users' BNB balances starting with November 24, and the sale itself will be conducted on December 1

Hooked Protocol is a project that's building a platform for onboarding users to the web3 ecosystem

This will be the first Binance Launchpad token sale since STEPN in March

Hooked Protocol (HOOK) will be having its token sale on Binance Launchpad

The Binance cryptocurrency exchange has announced the latest project that will be featured on the popular Binance Launchpad platform. Hooked Protocol will be looking to raise $2.5 million by selling 5% of the HOOK token supply to eligible participants on Binance Launchpad.

Hooked Protocol is a project that’s using gamified experiences to onboard a broader audience to the web3 ecosystem. One of the project’s products is Wild Cash, a “Learn-to-Earn” app that rewards users with tokens for demonstrating knowledge about crypto-related topics.

The Hooked Protocol ecosystem features a governance token called HOOK, as well as an incentive token called HGT. In addition to its governance functions, the Hooked Protocol also plans to implement HOOK as a gas token for the blockchain scalability solutions they will be launching.

As is usually the case with Binance Launchpad, the requirement for participating in the Hooked Protocol token sale is to hold BNB tokens on the Binance exchange. The size of a user’s BNB holdings determines how many tokens they can purchase during the token sale.

Participate in Hooked Protocol Token Sale

The Hooked Protocol token sale itself will be taking place on December 1, although Binance will start recording users’ BNB balances to determine eligibility starting with November 24. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the Hooked Protocol token sale timeline:

Preparation period: Between November 24 00:00 UTC and December 1 00:00 UTC

Subscription period: December 1, between 06:00 UTC and 09:00 UTC

Calculation period: December 1, between 09:00 UTC and 10:00 UTC

Token distribution: December 1, at 10:00 UTC

In total, 25 million HOOK tokens will be offered to participants on Binance Launchpad, which corresponds to 5% of the token’s total supply of 500 million. HOOK will be priced at the equivalent of $0.1 during the token sale (the actual price will be expressed in BNB), which would imply a $50 million fully diluted market cap for the HOOK token.

As is often the case, the markets for BNB have responded positively to the new Binance Launchpad token sale announcement. At the time of writing, BNB is displaying 16.3% gains on the day, with the BNB price approaching the $300 mark.

Let’s take a look at how the last 5 token sales on Binance have performed.

Summary

Companies $7.8 bln of trades were via Iran's biggest crypto exchange Nobitex

Revelations come amid U.S. Justice Department probe into Binance

Binance says is not a U.S. company, but has taken proactive steps to limit exposure to the Iranian marketplace

LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Crypto giant Binance has processed Iranian transactions with a value of $8 billion since 2018 despite U.S. sanctions intended to cut Iran off from the global financial system, blockchain data show.

Almost all the funds, some $7.8 billion, flowed between Binance and Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, according to a review of data from leading U.S. blockchain researcher Chainalysis. Nobitex offers guidance on its website on how to skirt sanctions.

Three-quarters of the Iranian funds that passed through Binance were in a relatively low-profile cryptocurrency called Tron that gives users an option to conceal their identities. In a blog post last year, Nobitex encouraged clients to use Tron - a mid-tier token - to trade anonymously without ""endangering assets due to sanctions.""

The scale of Binance's Iranian crypto flows – and the fact that they are continuing – has not been previously reported.

The new findings come as the U.S. Justice Department is pursuing an investigation into possible violations of money-laundering rules by Binance, which dominates the $1 trillion crypto industry, with over 120 million users. The transactions put the company at risk of falling afoul of U.S. prohibitions on doing business with Iran, lawyers and trade-sanctions experts said.

In July, Reuters revealed that Binance continued to serve clients in Iran and that the exchange's popularity in the Islamic republic was known inside the company. It was one of a series of Reuters investigations into Binance's troubled history with financial regulatory compliance. The day of that article's publication, Binance said in a blog post that it follows international sanctions rules on Iran and blocks access to the platform to anyone based there. The exchange's billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, tweeted: ""Binance banned Iranian users after sanctions, 7 got missed/found a workaround, they were banned later anyways.""

Binance didn't answer detailed questions about the new transactions uncovered by Reuters. In a statement, spokesperson Patrick Hillmann said, ""Binance.com is not a U.S. company, unlike other platforms that have exposure to these same U.S. sanctioned entities. However, we have taken proactive steps to limit our exposure to the Iranian marketplace,"" working with industry partners and internal tools.

Binance declines to give details of the location or the entity behind its Binance.com exchange.

Nobitex didn't respond to questions for this article. Nor did the Tron Network, based in the British Virgin Islands, and its founder Justin Sun.

In August 2021, Binance announced that customers would no longer be able to open accounts and use its services without identification. But since then, the exchange has processed almost $1.05 billion in trades directly from Nobitex and other Iranian exchanges, according to the Chainalysis data, which runs to November of this year. Since Zhao's tweet in July, Binance has processed around $80 million in Iranian trades.

Hillmann said in the Binance statement that the company requires full ""Know Your Customer"" checks for all users ""and residents of Iran are prohibited from opening or maintaining an account. We are continually updating processes and technology as we learn about new risks and potential exposures. As a result of these efforts, including real-time transaction monitoring in coordination with external vendors, between June of 2021 and November of 2022, Binance's exposure to Iranian-linked entities has seen an exponential decline.""

The data reviewed by Reuters show that in total some $2.95 billion in crypto moved directly between Iranian exchanges and Binance since 2018.

A further $5 billion in crypto moved between Iranian exchanges and Binance through layers of intermediaries, the data also reveal. Regulators say such ""indirect"" flows should be a red flag to crypto exchanges - an indicator of possible money laundering and sanctions evasion. Crypto users seeking to cover their tracks often use sophisticated techniques to create complex chains of crypto transfers.

Nobitex advises its 4 million customers on its website to avoid ""the direct transfer"" of crypto between Iranian and foreign crypto platforms to ""maintain security.""

Binance spokesperson Hillmann told Reuters in June, in relation to the exchange's indirect exposure to illicit funds, that ""what's important to note is not where the funds come from - as crypto deposits cannot be blocked - but what we do after the funds are deposited."" He said Binance uses transaction monitoring and risk assessments to ""ensure that any illegal funds are tracked, frozen, recovered and/or returned to their rightful owner.""

In addition to the Tron token, the remainder of the Iranian transactions were in major cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ether, tether and XRP, and a smaller token, litecoin.

Binance is the biggest market for trading Tron, according to industry data. Some other major exchanges, including U.S.-regulated Coinbase and Gemini, do not list the token.

Until recently, Tron has largely flown under the radar of cryptocurrency trackers. Market leader Chainalysis, used by U.S. government agencies, only began fully supporting the tracing of Tron this May, according to an email Chainalysis sent to a client.

The Tron dataset details over 1.15 million direct transfers between Binance and Nobitex since April 2020, when the first Tron flows were recorded. The data include wallet addresses and a unique identification number for each transaction.

Reuters obtained the Tron figures, along with further datasets covering the other crypto tokens, from three firms with access to Chainalysis' Reactor investigation software. Reuters cross-checked each company's figures. A fourth firm also confirmed some of the figures on direct transfers based on a separate dataset compiled using different software.

Reuters is making available here the data for direct transactions since August 20, 2021, amounting to around $1 billion.

The total volume of Iranian transactions flowing through Binance is far greater than through any other exchange, the data show. After Binance, the next most popular exchange for Nobitex users since 2018 was Seychelles-based KuCoin, which processed $820 million in direct and indirect transactions.

KuCoin and six other Iranian exchanges in the dataset– CoinNik Market, Iranicard, Rabex, Wallex, Sarmayex and Tether Land – did not respond to requests for comment.

SANCTIONS RISK

Binance has grown explosively since its launch in 2017. The company extended its reach from crypto last month by investing $500 million in Tesla boss Elon Musk's buyout of Twitter.

The main focus of the U.S. Justice Department investigation is whether Binance violated U.S. anti-money laundering laws. As part of the case, ongoing since 2018, the department is also investigating Binance for possible criminal sanctions violations in connection with Iran, three people with knowledge of the probe said. In late 2020, the department sought records from Binance on its compliance programme, including any documents related to the transfer of crypto funds for people or entities in countries including Iran.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

The U.S. government reimposed sanctions in 2018 on Iran that had been suspended three years earlier as part of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers. The West and the United Nations have targeted Tehran since 1979 with sanctions over its nuclear programme, along with alleged human rights violations and support for terrorism.

Six lawyers and sanctions experts said the Iranian transactions documented by Reuters put Binance at risk of U.S. ""secondary"" sanctions, designed to prevent non-U.S. firms from doing business with sanctioned entities or helping Iranians evade the American trade embargo. Secondary sanctions can choke off a company's access to the U.S. financial system.

Binance could also be exposed to direct ""primary"" sanctions if the company has what the U.S. Treasury Department calls a ""nexus to the United States,"" the lawyers and experts said. Such links can include any U.S.-incorporated entities, or transactions processed through the U.S. financial system or using the dollar, they said. Treasury didn't respond to a request for comment.

In 2019, Britain's Standard Chartered agreed to pay almost $930 million to U.S. authorities for criminal sanctions violations that included moving around $240 million via U.S. financial institutions for Iranian customers. Standard Chartered accepted responsibility for the violations. French bank BNP Paribas in 2014 agreed to plead guilty to violating U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran and to pay $8.9 billion. Both banks committed to improving their controls.

Binance says it does not accept customers in the United States. American clients are instead directed to a separate exchange called Binance.US, run by a U.S. company which since 2019 has been registered with the Treasury as a money-service business.

Binance CEO Zhao has described Binance.US as a ""fully independent entity."" Reuters reported in October that he in fact controlled the U.S. exchange and directed its management from abroad. A Binance adviser, in a message to executives in 2018, described the U.S. operation as a ""de facto subsidiary.""

In a blog post after that article, Zhao reaffirmed that Binance.US ""operates independently from Binance.com.""

The vast majority of the $8 billion in Iranian crypto transactions identified by Reuters involved the main Binance exchange. But Binance.US also processed crypto transactions worth $1.5 million from Iranian exchanges Nobitex, Wallex and Tether Land, the Chainalysis data show.

U.S. entities that violate the Iran sanctions can face criminal fines of up to $1 million per violation. People involved can face jail terms of up to 20 years. This October, the Treasury fined Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex $24 million for violating sanctions on Iran and other countries by processing crypto transactions worth over $260 million. Bittrex said at the time it was ""pleased to have fully resolved"" the matter.

Contacted for this article, a Binance.US spokesperson said Reuters' figures for its transactions with the Iranian exchanges were not accurate and that including ""direct as well as indirect transactional data from Chainalysis both conflates and inflates the volume you cite."" The spokesperson didn't provide an alternative figure.

Binance.US ""adheres to all applicable U.S. rules governing digital asset exchanges"" and only permits trading by entities that have completed a ""rigorous screening process,"" the spokesperson said.

Nobitex and the other Iranian crypto exchanges haven't been sanctioned by the United States. Reuters did not find evidence that sanctioned Iranian individuals, companies or organisations used Binance or Binance.US.

""THE BEST OPTION""

Nobitex, the largest Iranian exchange, launched in 2017. Its co-founder and CEO, Amirhosein Rad, did a doctorate in philosophy and chemical engineering at Iran's Sharif University of Technology, his LinkedIn profile shows. Rad didn't comment for this article.

Nobitex's aim, stated on its LinkedIn page earlier this year, is to allow Iranians to invest in crypto despite ""the shadow of sanctions."" As sanctions have hit Iran's ability to do business with the outside world, crypto has grown popular there for cross-border commerce. The exchange said it serves as a ""safe bridge between 3.5 million Iranians and the world of cryptocurrencies.""

Nobitex said in its 2021 annual report that it processes 70% of Iranian crypto transactions. The exchange has recommended that its clients use Binance in multiple posts on its website and social media channels, as recently as this year.

Nobitex users began moving bitcoin through Binance in April 2018, the Chainalysis data show.

In a trading guide on Nobitex's website, first published in 2019 and updated this October, Nobitex advised users to open accounts to convert their Iranian rials into crypto and then make transfers to a foreign exchange such as Binance, which it called the ""most reliable."" Subsequent posts in 2020 said that ""for us Iranians, Binance is still the best option"" and that Binance ""causes fewer problems for Iranian users.""

Noting the risk posed by U.S. sanctions, Nobitex's public terms of use recommend customers avoid the ""direct transfer"" of crypto from Nobitex to Binance and instead create multiple digital wallets to move funds in separate stages.

The volume of Tron transactions between Nobitex and Binance surged from August 2020, the Chainalysis data showed.

That same month, Tron's founder, Sun, said on Twitter the digital coin had enabled a new feature that allowed traders to mask their identities. Sun wrote that the feature, known as zk-SNARK, would ""protect user data with the strongest privacy protection in the industry.""

An article published in a Justice Department journal last year said the feature allows the development of ""anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies"" that attract criminals ""like sharks to chum"" as they ""seek out privacy to conceal their conduct.""

Nobitex recommended that users open digital wallets with Binance to buy Tron due to its ""high security."" A Nobitex blog post in July 2021 said zk-SNARK was key to keeping those sending and receiving crypto ""hidden.""

Nobitex customers remained able to use Binance to trade Tron and other crypto tokens after Binance tightened its checks on clients on August 20, 2021, according to the data. Binance processed direct transactions from Nobitex totalling over $1 billion between that date and November of this year, far outstripping any other international exchange, it showed. As recently as this October, $20 million in Tron flowed directly between Binance and Nobitex, the data show.

Iranians sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for cyberattacks and ransomware activity have used Nobitex, a Chainalysis report in September said. Between 2015 and 2022, the digital wallets of sanctioned Iranians received over $230,000 in bitcoin ransomware funds, Chainalysis said, with most of the crypto sent to Nobitex.

The Treasury said the same month that the sanctioned Iranians were all affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful faction that controls a business empire as well as elite armed and intelligence forces in Iran. Iranian authorities did not respond to a request for comment. The Iranian Foreign Ministry has called U.S. sanctions ""unilateral, illegal and cruel.""

2022-11-15,FTX debacle sees Nansen take stock of major exchange on-chain holdings - Cointelegraph,"The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has put industry peers under the microscope with calls for transparent accounts of token holdings and assets under management.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Huobi, OKX and Crypto.com have made efforts to share details of their assets and portfolios to assuage the wider space. This comes after investor confidence has been shaken, with users across the ecosystem moving Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens off exchanges to avoid potential contagion from the FTX fallout.

Blockchain analytics platform Nansen provides industry insights and is known for its wallet-labeling features that track addresses across multiple blockchains. In a series of tweets posted on Nov. 15, Nansen listed seven major exchanges, their relevant portfolios and explanatory statements of accounts.

The assets and net worth of the exchanges are the sum of holdings in wallet addresses provided by the firms on blockchains that Nansen monitors. The analytics platform also notes that the figures are not an “exhaustive or complete statement of the actual assets/reserves held.”

The exchanges accounted for include Binance, Crypto.com, OKX, KuCoin, Deribit, Bitfinex and Huobi.

Binance, widely regarded as the largest global exchange by transaction volume, holds around $64.3 billion worth of assets across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron and BNB Chain blockchains. This eclipses the other exchanges by a substantial amount.

Bitfinex has the second-largest asset holdings in reserve of the seven exchanges, according to data provided by the company. $8.23 billion of assets are held across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, Solana, Acala, Avalanche, Cosmos, Fantom, Near, Terra and Terra Classic blockchains.

Huobi’s assets amount to a traced $3.3 billion across eight different chains. OKX reportedly holds $5.84 billion in cryptocurrency assets across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Tron and Avalanche blockchains.

Crypto.com holds an estimated $2.36 billion in assets across seven chains. KuCoin addresses account for $2.65 billion in assets on eight different blockchains, and Deribit holds around $1.46 billion worth of assets on the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

Nansen co-founder and CEO Alex Svanevik told Cointelegraph that the firm is planning to publish preliminary findings on the FTX situation this week. Nansen previously unpacked on-chain findings after the cataclysmic collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9mdHgtZGViYWNsZS1zZWVzLW5hbnNlbi10YWtlLXN0b2NrLW9mLW1ham9yLWV4Y2hhbmdlLW9uY2hhaW4taG9sZGluZ3PSAWhodHRwczovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvZnR4LWRlYmFjbGUtc2Vlcy1uYW5zZW4tdGFrZS1zdG9jay1vZi1tYWpvci1leGNoYW5nZS1vbmNoYWluLWhvbGRpbmdzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-02,Hashflow Goes Live on Binance Launchpool—Earn HFT Tokens by Staking BNB or BUSD - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

Hashflow is the latest project to be featured on the Binance Launchpool platform

Users will be able to earn HFT tokens by staking BNB or BUSD

Hashflow is a decentralized exchange project with advanced functionality

The Binance cryptocurrency exchange has announced Hashflow as the latest project to be featured on the Launchpool platform. The exchange’s users will have the option to stake their BNB and BUSD tokens in order to earn HFT token rewards.

Hashflow is a decentralized exchange that offers interoperability and trades with zero slippage. Hashflow also implements MEV (maximal extractable value) protection to shield traders from front-running. The Hashflow DEX supports a variety of blockchain platforms, including:

The HFT token facilitates the governance process of the Hashflow protocol.

HFT token farming will be taking place on Binance between November 1 and November 30. In total, 15 million HFT tokens will be distributed to users through Binance Launchpool. This corresponds to 1.5% of HFT’s supply at token genesis.

Earn HFT on Binance Launchpool

Users can earn tokens by staking on Binance Launchpool

Binance Launchpool is a product offered by Binance that allows users to earn tokens from blockchain projects without taking on any major risks. In order to earn rewards, users are only required to temporarily stake their tokens in staking pools. The tokens can be unstaked at any time without penalties.

If you’re interested in Hashflow, Binance Launchpool can be a great way to get your hands on some HFT tokens without trading. This is especially true if you already hold some BNB or BUSD, and would like to put your tokens to work.

Binance Launchpool will provide two separate staking pools—one for BNB and another for BUSD. A total of 12 million HFT will be distributed to BNB stakers, while the remaining 3 million HFT will be going to BUSD stakers. It’s important to note here that this doesn’t necessarily mean that users staking BUSD will earn fewer HFT tokens. The amount of tokens earned by any given user will depend on how large their stake is compared to the entirety of the staking pool, as well as how long the tokens are staked for.

According to the exchange, HFT will be listed in the Binance “Innovation Zone” starting with November 7 at 13:00 UTC. This will make it possible for users to trade HFT on a spot market.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNzM1L2hhc2hmbG93LWdvZXMtbGl2ZS1vbi1iaW5hbmNlLWxhdW5jaHBvb2xlYXJuLWhmdC10b2tlbnMtYnktc3Rha2luZy1ibmItb3ItYnVzZC_SAXZodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDczNS9oYXNoZmxvdy1nb2VzLWxpdmUtb24tYmluYW5jZS1sYXVuY2hwb29sZWFybi1oZnQtdG9rZW5zLWJ5LXN0YWtpbmctYm5iLW9yLWJ1c2Qv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-20,Bitfinex closes week leading Bitcoin reserves according to Glassnode - CryptoSlate,"CryptoSlate analysts examined the detailed proof-of-reserves of leading crypto exchanges outside of Coinbase and Binance. It revealed that Bitfinex holds the most significant Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, with $3.5 billion worth of BTC.

The data was obtained on Dec. 16 from OKX, KuCoin, Crypto.com, ByBit, Binance, BitMEX, and Bitfinex. OKX follows Bitfinex with the second largest BTC pool with more than $1.5 billion in BTC, while Binance comes as the third with just above $5 billion in BTC. BitMEX places fourth, with just over $1 billion in BTC. Crypto.com, ByBit, and KuCoin came as the fifth, sixth and seventh with $700 million, $370 million, and $300 million, respectively.

Reserves in billions

Bitfinex, OKX, Binance, and BitMEX calculate their reserves in billions. Amongst all exchanges included in this analysis, Bitfinex emerged as the exchange that held significantly more BTC than the other six that released their proof-of-reserves.

Bitfinex

According to the numbers, Bitfinex entered the weekend with $3.5 billion in BTC and around $2.37 billion in UNUS SED LEO (LEO). The exchange also holds just below $1 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH).

Besides BTC, LEO and ETH, the chart shows that Bitfinex holds eight more assets in millions each.

Data from Nov. 21 showed that 91% of Bitfinex’s reserves were made of BTC and ETH, which meant that Bitfinex held the most BTC. Even though its ETH reserves have shrunk, the exchange still holds the largest amount of BTC.

Another study at the end of November 2022 showed that Bitfinex held over $11 billion worth of Tether (USDT), equating to 60% of the whole USDT supply. However, the current data indicate that this amount retreated to millions within two weeks.

OKX

OKX is the only exchange included in this analysis that measures its BTC reserves in billions. The exchange’s BTC reserves amount to just above $1.5 billion.

In addition to the considerable amount of BTC, OKX also holds around $2.43 billion in USDT. Furthermore, the exchange has just below $1.5 billion worth of ETH.

According to OKX’s announcement, it is also backing all its users’ assets at 1:1 with real funds.

Binance

Binance places third in ranking with nearly $5.6 billion in BTC. The exchange also holds $5 billion in ETH.

Despite the size of its BTC pool, Binance holds $15 billion in Binance USD (BUSD), $6.25 million in USDT, and almost $2.5 billion in USDC.

On Dec. 15, Binance experienced a withdrawal crisis where its reserves shrank by $3.5 billion in 24 hours. Despite that, the exchange holds the largest overall reserves amongst all other exchanges included in this analysis.

BitMEX

BitMEX holds the fourth largest BTC reserves, with around $1.1 billion. The data doesn’t disclose any other asset type under BitMEX’s reserves.

The exchange also announced that it plans to lay off around 30% of its staff in early November.

Reserves in millions

Other exchanges included in this analysis measure their reserves in terms of millions. Amongst the remaining four, Crypto.com holds the most BTC.

Crypto.com

Crypto.com entered the weekend with nearly $700 million worth of BTC and just above $600 million in ETH.

From Nov.21, 52% of Crypto.com’s reserves were made of BTC and ETH, which equated to 53,024 BTC and 391,564 ETH. Current data suggests that the exchange shrunk its BTC reserves while growing its ETH holdings.

Crypto.com also holds over $900 million worth of USD Coin (USDC) and around $500 million in SHIBA INU (SHIB).

The exchange released its proof of reserves on Dec. 6 and showed that all assets were fully backed by 1:1 on the exchange, with extra reserves to spare. However, the audit firm Mazars Group audited the proof of reserves, which revealed that it was preparing to drop its clients on Dec. 16.

ByBit and KuCoin

Based on the BTC reserves’ ranking, ByBit and KuCoin come fourth and fifth, respectively, with only slight differences in their reserves.

The numbers show that ByBit holds nearly $370 million in BTC and almost $200 million in ETH. In addition, the exchange also has over $700 million USDT and nearly $100 million USDC stablecoins.

ByBit recently announced that it would be updating its withdrawal limits based on verification levels and planning to lay off around 30% of its staff due to challenging market conditions.

KuCoin, on the other hand, holds a little less than $300 million in BTC and $200 million in ETH. The exchange has over $600 million in USDT and USDC stablecoins combined.

Following the FTX fallout, KuCoin was one of the first exchanges that disclosed its holdings. On Nov. 11, KuCoin’s CEO, Johnny Lyu, announced the exchange’s holdings via his Twitter account. In addition, the exchange released its proof-of-reserves on Dec. 5, which the Mazars Group audited.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL2JpdGZpbmV4LWNsb3Nlcy13ZWVrLWxlYWRpbmctYml0Y29pbi1yZXNlcnZlcy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tZ2xhc3Nub2RlL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL2JpdGZpbmV4LWNsb3Nlcy13ZWVrLWxlYWRpbmctYml0Y29pbi1yZXNlcnZlcy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tZ2xhc3Nub2RlLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-11,What You Need to Know About Exchange Tokens After FTX's FTT Meltdown - Decrypt,"In brief This Learn article will cover what exchange tokens are, what they are used for, how they are purchased, and the new scrutiny on them in light of FTX's reported malfeasance related to its FTT token.

It was the shot heard ‘round the crypto world.

On November 6, 2022, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said his company would move to liquidate its holdings of FTT, the native token of rival exchange FTX.

AD

AD

His announcement triggered an FTT selloff, bringing a top-five crypto exchange to its knees. FTX experienced a bank-run moment, with $5 billion worth of customer funds withdrawn in one day and didn't have the liquidity to cover.

In the aftermath of FTX's meltdown, reporting has revealed just how much FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's hedge fund Alameda were using FTT as collateral. Those revelations have put exchange tokens under the microscope.

This Learn article will look at exchange tokens like FTT, what they are for, and what risks they carry.

What is an exchange token?

An exchange token is one native to a cryptocurrency exchange and created by the company that runs the exchange, often framed as a ""utility token"" because it has use on the exchange.

The best-known examples of exchange tokens are Binance's BNB (the largest exchange token by market cap) and FTX's FTT. The other top centralized exchanges with their own tokens include KuCoin (KCS), Bitfinex (LEO), Crypto.com (CRO), OKX (OKB), and Huobi Global (HT).

How are exchange tokens used?

Crypto exchanges launch tokens for various reasons, including as customer incentives for staking the token, covering transaction costs, raising capital and liquidity, and in cases of exchanges that are governed by a DAO, serving as a governance token.

AD

AD

In the case of Binance, ""Along with ‘fueling’ transactions on BNB Chain (similar to gas on Ethereum), BNB also acts as a governance token,"" Binance says in a blog post explaining the token.

Binance says holding BNB gives investors the right to ""make your voice heard"" and is necessary to participate in BNB Chain's decentralized on-chain governance.

Over at KuCoin, ""KuCoin token holders get special discounts on trading fees and other associated costs within the KuCoin exchange,"" KuCoin says in its explanation of the benefits of its KCS token.

As KuCoin explains, the percentage of discounts an investor may receive is calculated based on the number of KCS tokens held by them.

In addition, KuCoin says KCS holders can use the exchange's token to pay transaction fees.

Crypto.com's CRO ""gives its users access to special rewards and discounts offered through its flagship credit card product,” Crypto.com writes.“As Crypto.com grew into an ecosystem of crypto solutions, CRO also added benefits such as lower trading fees, higher lending rewards, and more.""

How do you buy exchange tokens?

As their name suggests, investors can purchase these tokens through the token's parent exchange. In some instances, as with FTX's FTT token, they can also be bought on rival exchanges.

Unless the exchange has a fiat onramp, investors looking to load up on exchange tokens will need to swap their Bitcoin or Ethereum for the token. This process typically involves setting up an account and going through know-your-customer (KYC) verification.

AD

AD

Depending on the exchange, some tokens are only available in certain regions. For example, FTT is unavailable in the United States and other prohibited jurisdictions.

""If you are located in, incorporated or otherwise established in, or a resident of the United States of America, you are not permitted to transact in FTT,"" the FTX.com website says.

What are the risks with exchange tokens?

The risk involved with cryptocurrency exchange tokens may be obscure at first.

In cases like FTX, which appeared to the industry to be a strong global impact player, investing in FTT may have looked like a good idea. That was until we consider how many of those tokens a rival cryptocurrency exchange held.

As noted above, Binance held a large number of FTT tokens: 23 million, worth around $529 million. Binance held all that FTT because it was an early investor in FTX in 2019, and when FTX cashed out Binance's equity stake in July 2021, it paid out Binance in FTT.

When Binance announced it would liquidate its entire position and amid an ensuing liquidity crisis, FTT's value sank 85.6%.

As part of Binance’s exit from FTX equity last year, Binance received roughly $2.1 billion USD equivalent in cash (BUSD and FTT). Due to recent revelations that have came to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books. 1/4 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) November 6, 2022

Another risk with investing in exchange tokens is what is known as counterparty risk. In crypto, counterparty risk is mostly associated with stablecoins and the issuer's claim that a real-world asset backs the coin. Cryptocurrency exchange tokens carry a similar risk: What's backing them?

AD

AD

This risk includes whether the exchange has the liquidity it needs to back its token, backed by a reserve of any sort that it can tap into if—as in the case of FTX—liquidity dries up suddenly.

Because investors may need to exchange BTC or ETH to receive these exchange tokens, if the value or price of that token drops, there is no recourse to get back the exchanged BTC or ETH. The same risk comes with staking tokens.

Staking tokens lock them into the network or exchange, and while staked, the investor cannot move or trade those tokens. If the exchange suffers a meltdown or cyber attack, the tokens will potentially go with it.

Did you know? Not all cryptocurrency exchange tokens are compatible with hardware wallets. Check the list of supported coins and tokens of the wallet you want to use.

2022-12-23,Binance NFT Marketplace: How to Deposit NFTs to Binance - CoinCodex,"Binance is the largest crypto exchange platform in the world, serving tens of millions of users per day. Though it started as a simple centralized exchange for crypto spot trading, Binance has expanded significantly, adding several products and services. In 2021, it launched an NFT marketplace simply called Binance NFT.

The Binance NFT marketplace offers mystery boxes, exclusive NFT collections, Initial Game Offerings (IGOs), and many other features. In this article, we’ll be showing you how to deposit NFTs to Binance NFT so you can start trading them.

Deposit and trade NFTs on Binance

What you should know about the Binance NFT marketplace

The Binance NFT marketplace was launched in June 2021. Primarily, it serves as a marketplace where participants can create, buy and sell NFTs. Users can find NFTs in various categories, including sports, gaming, art, entertainment and mystery boxes that contain NFTs with varying rarities.

While the Binance NFT marketplace can be rightly regarded as a newcomer, it has achieved a lot in a little over one year. One of the major reasons for its growth is that it utilizes BNB Chain and also grants access to Ethereum assets. There are also plans to launch support for more blockchains.

Why deposit NFTs on Binance?

There are several NFT marketplaces in the cryptocurrency universe. But why deposit your NFTs on Binance rather than the other marketplaces?Depending on who you ask, there are many reasons to deposit NFTs on Binance. Here are some of the most relevant ones:

Ease of use

A good NFT marketplace should be easy to use and the Binance Marketplace is a great example. It has a simple yet powerful user interface that helps newbies navigate seamlessly and complete desired actions in a timely manner. The homepage, for instance, lists all the important categories to help users easily find what they want.

Multi-Chain support

Unlike some of its competitors, the Binance NFT marketplace is not limited to a single chain. It allows users to trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on both the BNB Chain and Ethereum networks. As the market continues to grow, the Binance NFT marketplace seems well-positioned to remain one step ahead of its competitors.

Market liquidity and volume

Liquidity and volume are important metrics in the crypto market, including the NFT scene. This makes it easy and fast for users to initiate and complete transactions. As more of Binance’s 60 million users in over 180 countries join the NFT train, it will become easier for users to trade their tokens quickly.

Low trading fees

Who wouldn’t want to trade at the lowest possible costs? Binance NFT marketplace offers NFT enthusiasts opportunities to trade for very low fees. The platform charges a flat 1% trading fee for both creators and sellers. When you deposit your NFT on Binance, you can be sure that the trading fee will be relatively lower than what’s offered by most other marketplaces.

Easy and fast cash out options

You also don’t want your money to get stuck after trading NFTs. With Binance, you are sure of easy and swift cash out at all times. Your Binance account comes with a Binance wallet from where you can make transactions quickly. It is also super-easy to convert the assets in your Binance wallet to cash. The available ways to convert your assets to fiat money on Binance include BNB & BUSD to fiat cash out, withdrawing cash via card or third-party payments (TPPs), and bank transfers.

User protection

You also want to deposit your NFTs on a secured platform where your assets will be protected at all times. All users operate with verified accounts, meaning that the chances of encountering a scammer within Binance are low. Binance also has other measures to protect users from the most scams in the crypto and NFT market.

How to deposit NFTs on Binance – a step-by-step guide

Are you eager to start depositing NFTs on the Binance NFT marketplace? Here are the key steps you should follow:

Connect your wallet

The first significant step is to connect your wallet to the Binance NFT marketplace, and below are the key steps to take:

Go to Binance NFT and log in to your account. Then, click on [Profile] – [Collected NFTs] – [Deposit].

From the Deposit NFT side panel, choose the network of your wallet (At the moment, Binance NFT Marketplace supports BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum. Make sure you select the right network or you won’t be able to view the NFTs and NFT collections in the connected wallet)

Select the wallet you want to connect (MetaMask and WalletConnect are the supported wallets at this time. If you are using MetaMask, for instance, you need to install the MetaMask extension in your Chrome browser before commencing the deposit process).

Once verified, your wallet will become connected (it is possible that the wallet will fail to connect at first and you will get an error message like “Wallet connection failed, try again’. You should repeat the steps above to try and connect your wallet again.

Select NFTs and/or NFT collections

Once your wallet is connected, you will find the NFTs and NFT collections it contains. If there aren’t NFTs from the whitelisted collection in the connected wallet, you will see an empty screen. You can search for specific NFT collections using the Search function. You can also go back to link a new wallet by clicking the exit arrow close to the [Deposit NFT] title.

Select the NFTs or NFT collections you want to deposit on Binance by checking the box next to each of them. Next, click on [Deposit Now].

You need to approve the NFT collection for the NFTs you intend to deposit on Binance individually. You will see a tick if a collection has been approved. You can always click [Retry] if a collection fails to connect. Clicking [Ignore] means you won’t be able to deposit the NFT collection on Binance.

Pay the gas fee

You will be required to pay a gas fee to approve NFT collections when you want to deposit NFTs on Binance. It is standard practice in among NFT marketplaces. Here is how you complete it:

Depending on the connected wallet, a pop-up will appear with the gas fee you need to pay to approve the deposit. Click [Confirm].

A [Deposit in Progress] window will appear. Wait patiently for your NFT deposit request to process. You will get a notification once the process is completed. You can retry if the process fails at any stage.

View your deposited NFTs

After successfully depositing your NFTs on Binance, you can view them easily by clicking [History] – [Deposits].

A multi-chain platform, Binance NFT marketplace also allows users to deposit NFTs from different sources. We’ve already discussed some of the major reasons to deposit NFTs on Binance.

2022-11-16,Crypto Exchange Gemini Suffers $485M Rush of Outflows Amid Contagion Fears - Yahoo Finance,"Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian founded by the Winklevoss brothers, has suffered a rush of withdrawals as crypto firms wrestle with the reverberations of the FTX-Alameda bankruptcy and subsequent contagion within the digital asset industry.

Data by blockchain intelligence platform Nansen shows that Gemini saw $485 million in net outflows in the past 24 hours, the largest among crypto exchanges. Outflows totaled $563 million, and were offset by only $78 million in inflows. In the past seven days, Gemini experienced a total of $682 million net outflows – the difference of $866 billion of inflows and $1.55 billion of inflows provided by Nansen – suggesting that most of the withdrawals have occurred on Wednesday.

Gemini endured the largest net outflows among crypto exchanges in the last 24 hours. (Nansen)

Digital asset balances on crypto wallets identified as Gemini dropped to $1.7 billion from about $2.2 billion a day ago, according to blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence. Arkham and Nansen do not cover data from the Bitcoin blockchain and may not include all Gemini’s wallets.

The rush of withdrawals came as Gemini paused withdrawals earlier Wednesday from its yield-generating Earn program. The lending unit of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading, which powered the program for Gemini, announced that it was suspending customer redemptions citing “extreme market dislocation” and “loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.""

The exchange also suffered an outage today, which was shortly resolved but exacerbated the fear about its stability.

Gemini had not return CoinDesk’s request for comment at the time of publication. Earlier today, the firm said in a tweet that all assets deposited by customers are available to withdraw at any time.

Contagion fear looms

Pressure has mounted on crypto exchanges and lending firms dealing with the implosion of top exchange FTX and its corporate sibling, trading firm Alameda Research.

Story continues

Cautious investors have scrambled to move digital assets from centralized exchanges amid “growing concerns about the solvency of other centralized exchanges,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a report this week.

Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin all experienced large deposit drawdowns recently, according to Nansen data. Some smaller platforms, such as AAX, Liquid and lender Salt, have halted withdrawals in the past few days.

Multiple exchanges attempted to mitigate widespread fear by sharing or promising to publish their crypto holdings. High-profile industry figures are advocating for presenting proof of reserves and performing independent audits of crypto holdings on a regular basis.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jcnlwdG8tZXhjaGFuZ2UtZ2VtaW5pLXN1ZmZlcnMtNDg1bS0yMzQyMzQwODQuaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL2NyeXB0by1leGNoYW5nZS1nZW1pbmktc3VmZmVycy00ODVtLTIzNDIzNDA4NC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-13,Here are the top five exchanges that are alternatives to Binance ... - Cryptopolitan,"Binance is the most popular cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world and is also regarded as one of the most secure. It is utilized on a massive scale in every region of the world, and it continues to amass licenses in nations that place use restrictions on it. As can be anticipated, the exchange has plenty of rivals. The following is a look at the top 5 best alternatives to Binance.

Kraken

Kraken is a decentralized digital asset exchange that allows users to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges and facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of more than 120 different currencies with exchange costs that are among the most competitive.

It’s remarkable that it allows for both instantaneous market-rate spot trading and futures trading in cryptocurrencies. When it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges, very few platforms can compare to Kraken’s level of security.

Kraken issued proof-of-reserve audits in February. Kraken adds a “audits” button to Merkle tree user accounts. Users can easily check their accounts to see if Kraken audited their wallet balances.

Users can also get their audit record ID to validate it against Kraken’s database, which uses Armanino. Kraken’s proof-of-reserves page provides technical details for reconstructing a Merkle tree to verify balances.

Coinbase

Coinbase is a popular cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates these transactions with ease. Cryptocurrency may now be purchased with the same ease as stocks via an online brokerage. As the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, Coinbase is where most people buy and sell digital currency.

Coinbase may not support all cryptocurrencies, however, they do support the vast majority of the market cap. As a result, the vast majority of Coinbase users should have a positive trading experience.

If you’re just starting off, this is the perfect thing for you. More experienced traders, however, may discover that they are better served by opening an account elsewhere.

Gemini

Gemini Exchange is Gemini’s cryptocurrency buying and selling marketplace. The exchange offers a wide variety of goods for both novice and experienced traders, including charting and immediate trading.

The Winklevoss Twins’ crypto platform Gemini announced last month the launch of a “Trust Center” to provide users with a detailed account of their assets. In a page published on its website, Gemini claims that it has over $4.6 billion in cryptocurrency assets and $601 million in its treasury to support its stablecoin GUSD.

KuCoin

The KuCoin Exchange is a major marketplace for buying, selling, and trading digital currencies. The platform supports more advanced forms of trading like margin, derivatives, and P2P (peer-to-peer).

Staking and lending one’s cryptocurrency to others is another option for users looking to profit from their holdings. KuCoin is an excellent Binance alternative because of its cheap trading costs compared to the others.

Bitfinex

Bitfinex is a widely-used platform that lists and trades in more than 170 different digital currencies. Low transaction costs and excellent liquidity make it a top pick for aggressive traders and investors.

The platform includes tools that are useful for both novice and seasoned traders. However, it has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny and accusations of deceiving consumers in the past.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b3BvbGl0YW4uY29tL3RvcC1maXZlLWV4Y2hhbmdlcy1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtdG8tYmluYW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Judging by the glass-half-full price action this week, the worst of the damage from FTX’s historic collapse may be behind us—but this being crypto, nothing is certain.

This week, heads turned towards crypto prime broker Genesis, which recently suspended withdrawals on its lending side due to the fact that its derivatives business had $175 million exposure to FTX.

Crypto trader @CryptoCred posted a timeline of Genesis’s statements about its FTX exposure over this last month. It goes to show the validity of the saying “watch what they do, not what they say.”

Genesis Timeline November 8: ""No material net credit exposure"" November 9: We lost $7M November 10: Okay, we have $175M locked in FTX November 16: Sorry, no withdrawals or new loans November 17: Okay, we need $1BN November 21: We'll go bankrupt without the money 👍 — Cred (@CryptoCred) November 21, 2022

The news also affects the business of popular crypto exchange Gemini. Last week, it warned of major delays for users looking to withdraw their cash from its Earn product, which was in part serviced by funds borrowed from Genesis.

On Tuesday, Gemini tried to reassure its Earn customers:

1/5 Update for Earn customers: we continue to work with Genesis Global Capital, LLC (Genesis) — the lending partner of Earn — and its parent company Digital Currency Group, Inc. (DCG) to find a solution for Earn users to redeem their funds. — Gemini (@Gemini) November 22, 2022

Reserves

One positive step for the industry after FTX is an increased interest in things like security, decentralization, and consumer protections. Certain businesses actually did well both during and after the catastrophe, including self-custodying solutions like cold wallet manufacturers and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Another thing consumers want from their centralized exchanges (CEXs) going forward is proof of reserves, and they certainly don’t want to see too much of the exchange’s funds being backed by tokens the exchange created itself, as was the case with FTX and its native token FTT. In light of this, KuCoin’s reserves are at the limits of acceptability, according to The Block Research:

KuCoin holds nearly one-fifth of its reserves in KCS, its own exchange token. Should this percentage start growing rapidly, it may become a cause for concern, just like how the illiquid FTT formed the bulk of FTX’s balance sheet. pic.twitter.com/DTvlqHihO7 — The Block Research (@TheBlockRes) November 21, 2022

Jesse Powell, the former CEO of Kraken, another popular CEX, laid down the law for transparent and secure reserves:

2/2 #ProofOfReserves audit must have:

1. sum of client liabilities (auditor must exclude negative balances)

2. user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum

3. signatures proving that the custodian has control of the walletshttps://t.co/QEZo0DzJfw — Jesse Powell (@jespow) November 22, 2022

2022-11-09,Solana Price Crashes 40% In a Day Amidst FTX and Alameda Research Uncertainty - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

Solana has seen a price drop of over 40% in the last 24 hours

SOL is now trading at its lowest levels since March 2021

The sell-off is fueled by serious troubles at FTX and Alameda Research, which are both major backers of Solana and its ecosystem

SOL price crashes amid uncertain FTX and Alameda Research situation

The Solana price has crashed by more than 40% in the last 24 hours amidst turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets. Of course, the most notable event in the crypto markets recently is the bank run on FTX, which was triggered by speculation that the exchange and its affiliated trading firm Alameda Research were insolvent. With FTX unable to access enough liquidity to cover all withdrawal requests, there are now plans for the exchange to be acquired by Binance, its biggest rival.

While the FTX / Alameda Research crisis has impacted the cryptocurrency market as a whole, some crypto assets have been impacted much harder than others. This of course includes FTX’s FTT token, but also coins such as Solana in which FTX and Alameda Research have significant investments.

Since both FTX and Alameda Research are both in dire need of liquidity, it’s reasonable to expect that they would be selling off their crypto holdings such as SOL. This undermined the market’s confidence in SOL, leading to a major sell-off.

Besides FTX and Alameda Research being forced to sell SOL, the situation has also created concerns about how FTX being potentially acquired by Binance would affect the Solana ecosystem on a fundamental level—this has also negatively impacted the price of SOL. While Solana’s future could still be bright, the apparent downfall of FTX could provide a setback for its ecosystem.

FTX is one of the biggest supporters of Solana itself as well as various projects building on the platform. Binance, on the other hand, is of course expected to prioritize the BNB Chain ecosystem.

Today, the SOL price hit a local bottom of $15.9, which is the lowest price since March 2021. SOL/USD is down a massive 47% in the last 30 days. In comparison, Bitcoin has lost 8.3% against the dollar in the same time period, while Ethereum is down 8.1%.

It's not all doom and gloom for Solana

If we focus on some positive Solana news, the project has recently announced a partnership with hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, which will entail a suite of integrations between the Solana Mobile platform and Ledger’s Ledger Live and Ledger Connect products.

In addition, Google’s cloud computing arm Google Cloud has recently revealed that they are running a validator for the Solana blockchain. Google Cloud also says that it will allow customers to launch dedicated Solana nodes through its Blockchain Node Engine product. The feature is expected to launch next year.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMDMwL3NvbGFuYS1wcmljZS1jcmFzaGVzLTQwLWluLWEtZGF5LWFtaWRzdC1mdHgtYW5kLWFsYW1lZGEtcmVzZWFyY2gtdW5jZXJ0YWludHkv0gF0aHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjEwMzAvc29sYW5hLXByaWNlLWNyYXNoZXMtNDAtaW4tYS1kYXktYW1pZHN0LWZ0eC1hbmQtYWxhbWVkYS1yZXNlYXJjaC11bmNlcnRhaW50eS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-19,What is Mazars? Meet the accounting firm rocking the crypto world that previously ditched Trump - Yahoo Finance,"Mazars has found itself in the headlines again this year after confirming it’s pausing work for crypto clients, including Crypto.com, KuCoin, and Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.

The news rocking the cryptocurrency world comes after the accounting firm in February backed away from another high-profile client — former President Donald Trump.

On Friday, Mazars told Yahoo Finance that it ""paused its activity relating to the provision of Proof of Reserves Reports for entities in the cryptocurrency sector due to concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public.""

Here’s what else to know about the accounting firm.

Exterior view of the tower housing the headquarters of Mazars, an audit and consulting firm located in the Paris-La Défense business district

What is Mazars?

Mazars is an international professional service firm that provides various financial services, including audit (49%), tax (16%), and outsourcing (16%), according to the firm’s 2020/2021 transparency report.

It operates in 90 countries but the majority of its offices and professionals are located in the European region. Mazars has 12 offices in the U.S., including in California, New York, Texas, and Florida.

In 2021, Mazars reported a fee income of $2.22 billion ( €2.1 billion).

What services did Mazars provide to crypto firms?

Mazars issued proof-of-reserve reports (PoR) for cryptocurrency exchange clients. The purpose of PoR reports is to verify that there are enough assets held by exchanges to back customer balances.

“It’s something that has been mentioned more and more since the FTX collapse,” said Romain Dillet, senior writer at TechCrunch. “Basically it’s like saying, ‘here’s what I have in my wallet and here’s what my customers hold on my exchange.’”

Ultimately, the exchanges wanted to provide customers with assurance.

“If everybody tries to withdraw everything at the same time, exchanges with reserves that are higher than customer deposits will be able to process all withdrawal requests,” Dillet said.

For instance, Binance explained its PoR system after the FTX fallout on its site and showed a 101% Bitcoin reserve ratio. Crypto.com also posted its Mazars PoR report on its website with an option to verify customer funds.

Story continues

However, the Mazars PoR report specifically noted that these are not financial audit engagements and the firm does not express an opinion or assurance conclusion.

The Mazars report on Binance’s BTC reserve is no longer available on the firm’s website. Mazars removed all proof-of-reserve reports for cryptocurrency exchanges, according to TechCrunch, and Mazars currently does not list “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain technology” as industries it serves on its website.

Why did Mazars pull back?

After issuing PoR reports for Cyrpto.com and KuCoin earlier this month, Mazars said it’s suspending these reports over concerns on how the reports are interpreted by the public., according to a statement it provided to Yahoo Finance.

“Proof of Reserves Reports are performed in accordance with Reporting Standards relevant to an Agreed Upon Procedures report,” according to the statement. “They do not constitute either an assurance or an audit opinion on subject matter. Instead, they report limited findings based on the agreed procedures performed on the subject matter at a historical point in time.

What was Mazars’ relationship with Trump?

TOPSHOT - Former US President Donald Trump

Earlier this year, Mazars cut ties with another notable client, former President Donald Trump and his family business.

Trump used Mazars as his longtime accounting firm, its services included issuing statements of financial condition for the former president. These statements included the valuations of Mr. Trump’s assets, including real estate properties. However, in a letter to the Trump Organization in February, William Kelley, Mazars U.S. general counsel, said Trump’s financial statements from June 30, 2011, to June 30, 2020, “should no longer be relied upon.”

The accounting firm also said they will no longer provide any services to Trump and his businesses.

What legal liability do accounting firms have?

Mazars, like every other accounting firm and its CPAs, is obligated to uphold standards such as good faith, due professional care, and public interest.

Firms have the legal responsibility to ensure financials are appropriately stated. Otherwise, clients, investors, or third parties who rely on their work can sue for negligence or fraud.

Accounting companies in the past had collapsed due to bad audits. Arthur Andersen, once a “Big 5”’ accounting firm along with PwC, KPMG, EY, and Deloitte, collapsed in 2002 due to its involvement in the Enron scandal.

Workers remove accounting firm Arthur Andersen's sign from their central business district offices in Sydney May 21, 2002.

Andersen turned a blind eye when Enron Corp. misreported financials to mislead investors. The leading audit partner failed to report issues to the company Board and tried to cover up the fraud amid an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mazars reminded the Trump Organization that “Mazars performed its work in accordance with professional standards” in its breakup letter in February. Mazars again reminded the public of its adherence to reporting standards as it suspends cryptocurrency-related work.

Mazars has not provided further information on its suspension decision to Yahoo Finance.

2022-11-01,AllianceBlock’s Funding Platform Fundrs Announces Official Listing For DUA Token - CoinCodex,"Key highlights:

$DUA is set to become the first platform to launch on the Ethereum-based peer-to-peer funding platform, Fundrs.

Launched in Q3 2022, Fundrs has been on a mission to build a decentralized participatory economy. The development marks a step further towards fulfilling its goal.

Fundrs, a peer-to-peer (P2P) proprietary funding platform built on the Avalanche and Ethereum networks by the AllianceBlock crypto company, has announced the official listing of the DUA token on its platform.

The launch apparently marks another win for the dua ecosystem as the project had recently concluded a $4M funding round prior to the listing on Fundrs. Following plans to tokenize its 5M+ users through cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies, Swiss-based startup dua AG, in collaboration with its partner dua foundation, has decided to launch the DUA token on Fundrs.

$DUA Emerges First Project to Launch on Fundrs

According to the announcement, the launch will see the dua token become the first project to officially list on Fundrs. Hence, a major milestone that will facilitate DUA's ability to support the new economic system around globally-fragmented communities.

The decentralized funding project Fundrs in its progressive efforts to foster exclusive access to notable companies in a fair, transparent and inclusive participatory economy, will begin to support the dua token on its platform. Hence, users of the DUA token can begin to enjoy funding services on Fundrs by means of integration.

The token listing aligns with the dua's plans to introduce globally fragmented communities to the DUA token and Web3 through the apps dua.com and spotted.de, according to the whitepaper released by the platform.

The launch will see the project providing its users with a tokenized experience that establishes a reward system based on in-app activities and user reputation. As such, end-users can easily participate and benefit from a fairer economy.

The Chief Payments Officer at dua.com, Ardit Trikshiqi, explained the relevance of the token listing on Fundrs, saying:

""The launch of the DUA token is an innovation for the matchmaking industry. DUA will enable 5 million users of dua.com and spotted.de to engage in a participative virtual economy that offers a wide range of services and is growing exponentially every day and millions of individuals and businesses, part of globally fragmented communities that are not being supported by traditional financial providers such as banks or money transfer operators.”

Basically, Fundrs envision a community where it can empower capital providers into becoming a crucial part of a project's life cycle by giving them an opportunity to play a role in the funding, advising, marketing, and operation of any project. Hence, the release of $DUA on its platform will see Dua emerging as the first project to leverage that vision using Fundrs.

The token's official listing on Fundrs makes dua the first in a long line of innovative ventures that has the opportunity to be included in a participatory economy that champions reputation and merit.

Fundrs to Build a Decentralized Participatory Economy

The revolutionary peer-to-peer funding platform had recently entered the blockchain industry in August 2022. The initiative behind the project was birthed in compliance with AllianceBlock's desire to deploy necessary infrastructures capable of building a truly decentralized participatory economy.

AllianceBlock is a decentralized ecosystem that seeks to bridge the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. The platform seeks to achieve this by remediating issues in the decentralized and traditional spheres and linking them more closely.

The decentralized ecosystem is increasingly gaining traction as each day passes. Hence, new and existing projects within the industry are seeking to create unique innovations that could make the space more productive and efficient for users.

Fundrs is one of the projects seeking to provide an innovative launchpad for young ventures to have access to advice and capital that is available, traditionally, to a select few. Nonetheless, Fundrs mother platform AllianceBlock has been able to facilitate a seamless gateway from traditional (TradFi) to decentralized finance (DeFi).

The token launch represents a driving force that tends to encourage the platform's goal to build a decentralized participatory ecosystem.

The Founder and CEO of AllianceBlock, Rachid Ajaja, commented on the new development saying, “Fundrs is a revolutionary step in our vision towards a truly decentralized participatory economy. It is a culmination of our original vision in 2018 to provide unbiased access to a peer-to-peer funding platform based on reputation and merit.""

""With dua as our first listing we will be able to target globally fragmented communities which is fully in line with our mission to bring access to the best companies in a fair, transparent and inclusive participatory economy,"" Ajaja added.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNTU3L2FsbGlhbmNlYmxvY2tzLWZ1bmRpbmctcGxhdGZvcm0tZnVuZHJzLWxpc3RzLWR1YS10b2tlbi_SAV5odHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDU1Ny9hbGxpYW5jZWJsb2Nrcy1mdW5kaW5nLXBsYXRmb3JtLWZ1bmRycy1saXN0cy1kdWEtdG9rZW4v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-13,Bitcoin in El Salvador — The First Country to Adopt BTC as Legal Tender - CoinCodex,"In September 2021, El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. By supporting Bitcoin, El Salvador made a huge step forward in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency.

The move to adopt Bitcoin, which was strongly supported by El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, has been met with both praise and criticism. Supporters of the decision note that it could provide economic opportunities for El Salvador’s citizens and boost the country’s economy. Meanwhile, critics are saying that the volatility of BTC might expose El Salvador to risks, and there are also concerns about whether it is appropriate to promote Bitcoin to such a large audience.

Regardless of the opinion, one thing is certain: El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender provides a clear example for other countries to follow and could further the cryptocurrency’s acceptance across the globe.

In this article, we’ll be taking a look at how El Salvador’s crypto adventure has been unfolding to better understand the impact of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin law

The Bitcoin Law, which was passed by the country’s Congress in June 2021, states that BTC can be used as legal currency for any transaction. According to the law, businesses should quote prices in BTC in addition to USD and the cryptocurrency has equivalent legal status to the US dollar, the country’s official currency.

The Chivo wallet

In order to facilitate the use of Bitcoin in El Salvador, the country launched the Chivo wallet. The wallet has been designed to enable users to easily and securely store their Bitcoin and pay for goods and services using the cryptocurrency. The wallet also allows users to send and receive Bitcoin, as well as to convert it into US dollars.

Are people in El Salvador adopting Bitcoin?

Since the announcement, there has been a surge of interest in Bitcoin from people living in El Salvador. According to reports, around 4 million citizens have already downloaded the Chivo wallet. Given that the country has a population of about 6.5 million, this is certainly impressive on the surface level. However, there are signs that Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador has been much slower than the number of Chivo wallet downloads would suggest.

We need to keep in mind that El Salvador offered a free $30 worth of Bitcoin to any citizen that set up their Chivo wallet. This promotion likely played an important role in the initial spike in interest for the Chivo wallet.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a United States-based organization, only 20% of the users who set up their Chivo wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus they received.

Meanwhile, CNBC cites a survey from the El Salvador-based think tank El Instituto de Opinion Publica as showing that 76% of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in the country do not accept Bitcoin.

How much money has El Salvador lost with Bitcoin?

In addition to adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has also made investments in BTC itself. As of December 12, 2022, the country has purchased 2,430 BTC, which is worth approximately $41.3 million.

As of December 12, 2022, El Salvador had an unrealized loss of about $66.6 million on its Bitcoin investment. In percentage terms, the country’s BTC investment was down 61.7%, or $66.6 million in absolute terms.

When El Salvador introduced Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, the price of BTC was between $51,000 and $44,000 (it was a particularly volatile day in the Bitcoin market). The Bitcoin price has since dropped all the way down to $17,000 which has prompted many critics to announce the death of Bitcoin. However, it’s certainly possible that BTC will recover in the future like it has many times before.

Why did El Salvador adopt Bitcoin as legal tender?

El Salvador has several interesting motivations for accepting Bitcoin. Let’s explore some of the benefits that BTC could bring to the country.

Increasing efficiency in international remittances

The decision to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender is expected to have a major impact on El Salvador’s economy and its citizens. For starters, it is expected to reduce the cost of international remittances by cutting out the need for international money transfer services like Western Union and MoneyGram, which charge significant fees. In addition, the move could make it easier for El Salvadorans living abroad to send money back home.

Boosting economic growth

El Salvador’s economy has been struggling with low growth for several years, and the adoption of Bitcoin could provide a much-needed stimulus. In addition, it could attract more foreign investment into the country’s economy.

Creating new job opportunities

As more and more businesses start accepting cryptocurrency as a method of payment, the rise of Bitcoin might create new job opportunities.

Reducing transaction costs

In order to make it easier for its citizens to access global markets, El Salvador has reduced the cost of international payments and made it easier for them to send money quickly and securely.

Promoting financial inclusion

The World Bank estimates that only around half of El Salvador's population has a bank account, leaving millions of people without access to basic financial services. By accepting Bitcoin, the government of El Salvador is taking steps to improve financial inclusion and provide people with a secure way to store and transfer their money.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin City plans

In addition to adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender, El Salvador is also planning to create a ‘Bitcoin City. Renewable energy will power the city and will be a hub for Bitcoin-related businesses, including mining companies and exchanges.

This is a major step forward in cryptocurrency adoption and will no doubt help to further legitimize the use of Bitcoin. This ambitious project could help to put El Salvador at the forefront of the global cryptocurrency market and could attract more businesses and investors from around the world. However, the infrastructure for this project is still in its early stages and will require significant investment before it can become a reality.

The project, called Bitcoin Beach El Salvador, aims to develop a hub for technology and innovation that Bitcoin will power. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, and his government, who are hoping to use this venture to spur economic growth in the country and attract foreign investment, spearhead the project.

The project is expected to be located in La Libertad, a small coastal town on the Pacific Ocean. The plan is to build an infrastructure that will support businesses and entrepreneurs who want to use cryptocurrency for payments. This includes retail stores, restaurants, and other services that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. The government is also planning to attract blockchain-based startups by offering tax incentives and other incentives.

Conclusion

El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender is a historic moment for the cryptocurrency and could be a major step forward in its adoption. The country is leading the way in terms of Bitcoin adoption and is setting an example for other countries to follow.

In addition, El Salvador’s investment in a ‘Bitcoin City’ could provide citizens with access to banking services and further legitimize the use of cryptocurrency. However, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has been relatively slow, and the country has seen significant (unrealized) losses on its BTC investments.

Ultimately, the success of El Salvador’s bet on BTC will depend on how Bitcoin performs in the next few years.

2022-11-11,Binance Provides Proof of Reserves in Response to FTX Collapse ... - Cryptonews,"Binance Provides Proof of Reserves in Response to FTX Collapse – This is How Much Money They Have

The major crypto exchange Binance has revealed details about its reserves as nervousness started to spread in the crypto community following the collapse of rival exchange FTX.

According to the information Binance has revealed so far, the exchange held the following digital assets as of November 10:

475k BTC

4.8m ETH

17.6b USDT

21.7b BUSD

601m USDC

58m BNB

In total, the current market value of these cryptoassets at the time of writing is close to $71bn.

The exchange stressed in an article published on its website that the above is “not a complete set of data,” and that further details will be shared in an upcoming full audit report.

In addition to the balance of the six major coins, the article also provided the specific wallet addresses that are under Binance’s control on the BTC, ETH, BSC, BNB, and TRX networks.

The same information was also shared by Binance CEO Changpeng (“CZ”) Zhao himself on Twitter. He added in a follow-up tweet that this list of addresses is tentative until a full proof of reserves has been completed, which he said “may take weeks.”

Binance added on its website that its so-called “SAFU fund,” an emergency insurance fund for users, has been topped up and now stands at $1b.

Other companies follow suit

In addition to Binance, companies such as Crypto.com, Kraken, OKX, Deribit and a number of others have either published, or said they will publish, proof of reserves, after CZ first encouraged industry players to do so.

The latest update on Friday came from Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, who shared his company’s wallet addresses directly in a Twitter thread. Like Binance’s CZ, Marszalek also stressed that the wallets represent only a portion of the reserves, and that a full proof of reserves report can be expected “in the next couple of weeks.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9iaW5hbmNlLXByb3ZpZGVzLXByb29mLW9mLXJlc2VydmVzLXJlc3BvbnNlLWZ0eC1jb2xsYXBzZS1ob3ctbXVjaC1tb25leS10aGV5Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-01,Magic Eden Launches Solana NFT Tool to Enforce Creator Royalties - Decrypt,"In brief Magic Eden has launched the Open Creator Protocol, which it says can enforce creator royalties on Solana NFTs that use the tool.

In October, the leading Solana NFT marketplace made creator royalties optional for buyers to pay. That’s still true for existing collections.

Creator royalties are at threat in the NFT space, especially on Solana, where effectively all marketplaces with any significant share have stopped requiring traders to pay the fees. But now the leading Solana marketplace, Magic Eden, has taken a step towards creating a more durable system to enforce creator royalties.

The $1.6 billion startup today announced the Open Creator Protocol (OCP), an open-source tool that creators of new Solana NFT projects can implement to ensure that royalties are paid whenever their assets are traded on secondary marketplaces. It’s built on top of Metaplex’s existing SPL token standard for NFTs on Solana.

Creator royalties are fees that are paid, typically by the seller, on NFT trades. They are typically set between 5% and 10% of the sale price, with the funds going to a digital wallet controlled by the creators of the NFT project. These fees can be a lucrative source of revenue for NFT projects that generate significant secondary trading volume.

Magic Eden's OCP appears to be similar in approach to OpenSea’s recent Ethereum toolkit, allowing NFT creators to block marketplaces that won’t honor royalty fees on eligible assets. In other words, if a marketplace refuses to enforce royalties for OCP-enabled NFTs, then that platform will be put on the OCP blocklist and those NFTs can’t be traded through it.

“Creators have the option to adopt the Open Creator Protocol, which will allow them to use the protocol to protect their royalties and create their own rules of their collection’s trading,” Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu told Decrypt. “This will only be available to creators launching new collections, but we feel many will opt into the protocol.”

Lu said that Magic Eden itself will maintain a list of blocked marketplaces, but also that creators can choose to customize the list of blocked platforms. The open-source tool—which will be available for creators to use on Friday—can be supported by any Solana NFT marketplace that wishes to honor royalties on OCP projects, he added.

Magic Eden enforced creator-set royalties until mid-October, when a wave of rival Solana NFT marketplaces began rejecting royalties or making them optional for traders, resulting in more money kept by sellers. Faced with dwindling market share in the Solana NFT space, Magic Eden opted to make royalties optional for buyers to pay, similar to a tip for creators.

Ethereum NFT platforms began following suit, as well, and top overall marketplace OpenSea said in early November that it was considering a similar move. Following creator backlash, however, OpenSea said that it will continue to honor royalties on existing collections, along with new projects that use its Ethereum blocklist tool. Rival marketplace X2Y2 has since taken that approach as well.

AD

Magic Eden’s new tool only serves creators who adopt it for newly launched projects, however, and the marketplace has not changed course on optional royalties for existing projects. The firm previously pledged $1 million towards the development of royalties enforcement tools, and Lu told Decrypt that creators may choose to re-mint projects using OCP if they wish.

“It’s not mandatory of course—it’s just an option, in the spirit of being solutions-oriented,” Lu explained. “While that might appear scary for some creators, some remain undaunted and we look forward to working with them.”

Magic Eden built the OCP tool independently of Metaplex, which is developing its own new royalties-enforcing Solana NFT asset class. Lu said that the team has been in contact with Metaplex and had already shared the tool ahead of today’s announcement, noting that Metaplex’s new standard isn’t due until Q1 2023.

“We don’t foresee any conflict between our protocol and what Metaplex plans to roll out. We want creators to have as much choice as possible,” Lu explained, pointing out that both will support migrating existing collections. “Our goal is for the ecosystem to consolidate a standard that any business can unreservedly build on top of.”

The OCP toolkit also enables additional functionality for creators, Magic Eden said. One feature is a dynamic royalty option that uses a linear price curve to cut down the total fee paid by buyers for higher-priced NFTs, potentially making royalties appear less daunting for pricey purchases.

Another feature lets creators customize certain transferability details, such as whether NFTs can be resold before the initial mint ends, as well as limits based on NFT metadata—or the details that specify an asset’s unique attributes—or total NFTs traded in a collection to date. Magic Eden suggests that such options can unlock “gamification” opportunities for NFT creators.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMTYyMTUvbWFnaWMtZWRlbi1zb2xhbmEtbmZ0LXRvb2wtZW5mb3JjZS1jcmVhdG9yLXJveWFsdGllc9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMTYyMTUvbWFnaWMtZWRlbi1zb2xhbmEtbmZ0LXRvb2wtZW5mb3JjZS1jcmVhdG9yLXJveWFsdGllcz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Musk Believes He’s at Risk for Assassination

Talking on a recent Twitter Space, the new owner of the platform shared that he believes himself to be at “significant” risk for assassination. Moreover, he notes that any potential threat to his life could be a possibility.

Musk noted he won’t “be doing any open-air car parades, let me put it that way,” when first broaching the subject. Then stating, “Frankly, the risk of something bad happening to me, or even literally being shot, is quite significant.”

Musk added, “It’s not that hard to kill somebody if you wanted to. So hopefully they don’t, and fate smiles upon the situation with me and it does not happen… there’s definitely some risk there.”

More than just his fears over potential harm, Musk spoke at length about his desire for Twitter. Consequently stating that his position as a “free-speech absolutist” informs his vision for the platform

“At the end of the day,” Must stated, “We just want to have a future where we’re not oppressed.” Additionally, Musk proclaimed, “[Where] our speech is not suppressed, and we can say what we want to say without fear of reprisals.”

Conclusively, Musk noted, “As long as you’re not really causing harm to somebody else, then you should be allowed to say what you want.”

The first month as the owner has been an interesting one for Musk. Mass layoffs, resignations, and platform controversy have marred his opening weeks. Ultimately, it will be interesting to see where Musk takes Twitter amidst this vision. His divisive nature, and the platform’s dire economic foundation, will make for an interesting development.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNheXMtdGhlcmUtaXMtc2lnbmlmaWNhbnQtcmlzay1vZi1oaXMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-06,Calvaria Presale Close To Finish after Raising $2M+ - Coinpedia Fintech News,"Sara is steadily working on cryptocurrency evaluations, news, and fluctuations in digital currency prices. She is guest author associated with many cryptocurrencies admin and contributes as an active guide to readers about recent updates on virtual currencies.

Calvaria, a new play-to-earn crypto game in which players battle for dominance of a fantasy underworld, has raised more than $2.1 million through a presale of its RIA token.

Less than 10% of RIA tokens allocated for the presale remain available, so investors need to hurry if they want to join the Calvaria project.

Calvaria’s presale is currently in Stage 5, which will be the final stage of the presale. RIA tokens are priced at $0.0325, which represents a 225% gain for investors who bought RIA at the start of the presale.

In total, the presale expects to sell 150 million RIA tokens, or 15% of the total supply, and raise $3.075 million in funds for the Calvaria project.

IEO on the Horizon

Once the presale has concluded, the team behind Calvaria has its eyes set on an initial exchange offering (IEO) for the RIA token.

Potential partners include Kucoin and Gate.io, with which Calvaria has already signed deals. Kucoin is the 3rd largest crypto exchange by trading volume and Gate.io the 4th, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Calvaria has also entered a partnership with XT.com, a social crypto trading platform.

A price for Calvaria’s IEO has not yet been announced. However, the success of the presale and the widespread interest in Calvaria suggest that the price could be significantly above the Stage 5 presale price of $0.0325.

Calvaria has received coverage from numerous financial outlets, including Yahoo! Finance, Benzinga, and Cryptonews. The project has also been featured on Business2Community, an online outlet focused on business owners, tech, and trading.

The Role of RIA

The RIA token plays a key role in the Calvaria ecosystem. In Calvaria’s play-to-earn game, Duels of Eternity, players collect NFT battle cards and play them against one another in strategic duels. Winning players earn RIA tokens as a reward for their victories.

RIA can be used to purchase additional NFT battle cards in Calvaria’s in-game asset marketplace. Using RIA to strengthen a battle card deck offers players the opportunity to win more RIA.

In addition, investors and players have the option to stake RIA and earn interest in RIA. 25% of the total RIA supply has been set aside for staking rewards.

Players and investors who stake a minimum threshold of RIA tokens receive votes in the Calvaria decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This gives players a say in the future development of Calvaria.

Mobile Gaming, Free Play & More

Calvaria is entering a play-to-earn gaming landscape that’s populated with several other battle card games, including Gods Unchained and Splinterlands. However, Calvaria is doing things differently and has a few unique selling points for players.

First, Calvaria will be one of the only mobile-native play-to-earn battle card games. Duels of Eternity will be launched on iOS and Android devices at the same time it goes live on the web. That’s expected to attract mobile gamers who have been resistant to playing computer-based crypto games.

Another unique feature of Calvaria is that it will offer a free-to-play version. Gamers who want to try out Calvaria but don’t want to commit to the game’s token ecosystem can try it out without buying RIA. The free-to-play version makes Calvaria far more accessible to gamers who have remained outside the world of P2E crypto gaming thus far.

Finally, Calvaria doesn’t require players to connect a crypto wallet. That’s another major advantage for attracting gamers who are not drawn to Calvaria’s play-to-earn features, but still want to take part in the game.

Speedy Layer 2 Implementation

Calvaria is a multi-chain project, but the development team has decided to use the Polygon network for all internal transactions. Polygon is an Ethereum-based Layer 2 solution that facilitates fast and inexpensive transactions.

The Calvaria project is supported by Polygon Studios.

Upland Partners FIFA, Gamifies FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™

The Metaverse gaming giant disclosed on Wednesday that it will begin to offer football fans the opportunity to collect NFTs of World of Cup highlights as anticipations on the World Cup Qatar 2022™ continue to surge.

Apparently, the deal demands global football fans to join Upland users to collect, trade and own FIFA digital assets and video game highlights. All thanks to FIFA's agreement to a multi-year partnership with Upland.

According to the announcement, the partnership deal will take effect in late November at the World Cup in Qatar. This will open football fans to the opportunity to learn how to participate and contribute to the virtual community-driven environment.

Fortunately, in addition to the opportunity to own collectibles of legendary video highlights from the much anticipated FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ matches, football fans can virtually support their favorite national team from any part of the world. All thanks to FIFA's integration with Upland.

Upland to Reward Fans With Replicas of FIFA-Branded Products

Per the announcement, Upland further revealed plans to introduce the replica of Lusail Stadium and other FIFA-branded apparel it had constructed to enhance the gaming mechanics while also establishing a reward system for fans. This includes FIFA World Cup-branded villages, shops, and showrooms.

Ahead of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ Upland had disclosed a new collection game to enable fans digital collection albums across all thirty-two (32) country teams represented. The collection game comes with a limited number of mystery bundles at multiple rarities available. The collection includes country-specific team crests, boots, shirts, and historic official World Cup logos, posters, and mascots.

Football fans who are able to complete the collections will earn more points to their fan scores. Meanwhile, fans who have earned the highest scores will be rewarded with virtual replicas of FIFA's real-world items.

The announcement suggests a massive gaming experience for football fans as the platform further unwrapped other core game mechanics it is eyeing with respect to its collaboration with FIFA. This includes the possible opportunities for fans to own special mementos of the 2022 tournament, including video highlights of the games which cannot be purchased directly from Upland.

Upland believes that no other world competition is capable of bringing countries and people from different parts of the world together like the FIFA World Cup, as noted by its Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Dirk Lueth.

Lueth further expressed his delights on the new partnership saying, “We’re excited to create a multi-touch web3 experience showcasing fun, innovation, entrepreneurialism and community as the first of many opportunities in the future of FIFA World Cups™, where fans can now collect, own, and share a real moment in history.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMDc5L2ZpZmEtc2lnbnMtbXVsdGkteWVhci1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLXVwbGFuZC1haGVhZC13b3JsZC1jdXAtcWF0YXItMjAyMi_SAXBodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTA3OS9maWZhLXNpZ25zLW11bHRpLXllYXItcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC11cGxhbmQtYWhlYWQtd29ybGQtY3VwLXFhdGFyLTIwMjIv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-02,Elon Musk & Dogecoin — How Did the World’s Richest Man Get Involved with a Meme Cryptocurrency? - CoinCodex,"Elon Musk’s Dogecoin support has baffled many in the mainstream media. Why would such a prominent figure publicly talk about a relatively niche cryptocurrency?

Whether you love him or hate him, it’s hard to deny that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is a highly influential figure. With an estimated net worth of $191 billion and the coveted status of being the world’s richest person, Musk has the power of influencing opinions and markets with as little as a tweet (coincidentally, Musk is now the owner of Twitter after acquiring it for a whopping $44 billion).

Elon Musk’s influence also extended to the cryptocurrency markets after he began mentioning his affection for Dogecoin, a popular cryptocurrency that the crypto community mostly perceives as a joke. Elon Musk first mentioned Dogecoin in 2019, but really began talking about DOGE extensively in 2021, when the cryptocurrency went on a massive price rally.

Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 2, 2019

What is Dogecoin?

Before we take a closer look at what Elon Musk and Dogecoin have to do each other, let’s first quickly run through through the history of Dogecoin.

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency with the ticker DOGE, which was launched in December 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. Even though the Dogecoin market capitalization is now worth billions of dollars, Dogecoin was initially intended as a joke that was poking fun at the rampant speculation in the cryptocurrency markets. The name Dogecoin is derived from the popular “doge” meme, and Dogecoin’s branding heavily features the iconic image of a Shiba Inu breed dog.

From a technical perspective, Dogecoin is a fork of the Luckycoin cryptocurrency. Luckycoin is a fork of Litecoin, which is itself a fork of Bitcoin. Dogecoin is secured through a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, and is merge mined with Litecoin.

Unlike Bitcoin and Litecoin, which both have a cap on the maximum number of coins that can exist, the DOGE maximum supply is theoretically unlimited. 5 billion new DOGE coins enter circulation every year.

In terms of features and technology, there is nothing especially innovative or remarkable about Dogecoin. DOGE’s appeal mostly stems from its humorous branding, and Dogecoin quickly attracted a dedicated community of fans on platforms like Reddit shortly after its launch. The Dogecoin community was known for using the meme appeal of DOGE to fund both charitable initiatives and promotions (for example, by sponsoring a NASCAR driver).

Let’s take a look at some example of Musk’s tweets triggering Dogecoin price spikes, as well as examples of Musk-related news driving rallies in the DOGE market.

Elon Musk’s influence on the DOGE market

On December 20, 2020, Elon Musk tweeted “One word: Doge”. This was immediately picked up by crypto market speculators, who sent the Dogecoin price from $0.039 to $0.046, an increase of about 18%.

On February 4, 2021 Elon Musk simply tweeted “Doge”. Shortly after, he said that “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto”. Within less than two hours of the initial tweet, the DOGE price increased from $0.0408 to $0.057, an increase of about 40%.

On April 28, 2021, Elon Musk tweeted “The Dogefather SNL May 8”, hinting towards his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live. The tweet resulted in the DOGE price increasing from $0.260 to $0.342, which is an increase of about 31%.

Beyond the multiple instances of Elon Musk’s tweets being almost immediately reflected in the DOGE price action, the price movements of Dogecoin are sometimes also driven by news related to Elon Musk. For example, Dogecoin rallied in October 2022 when Musk finalized his acquisition of Twitter (the acquisition was concluded on October 27). The price of DOGE more than doubled between October 25 and November 1, 2022.

With all of this in mind, it’s clear that whenever you’re making your Dogecoin price prediction, Elon Musk’s support for the project is an extremely important factor to consider.

Dogecoin’s massive 2021 bull run

2021 was an extremely bullish period for the cryptocurrency market, with many major cryptocurrencies hitting their all-time high prices. Investors, many of which were not too familiar with how to invest in crypto, seemed to be willing to park their money into just about any cryptocurrency, and there was a general sense of exuberance and FOMO (fear of missing out) in the market.

Following Elon Musk’s public “endorsements” of Dogecoin, social media users on platforms like Twitter and TikTok began encouraging each other to buy Dogecoin with the goal of sending the price of Dogecoin to $1.

All of this created a perfect storm that allowed Dogecoin to go on one of the most impressive rallies the cryptocurrency sector has ever produced. The Dogecoin price was about $0.005 on January 1, 2021. On May 8, 2021, the DOGE price hit its all-time high of $0.738, an unbelievable 147.6x price increase from the start of the year.

DOGE’s all-time high came coincided with Elon Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live, which also happened on May 8, 2021. While Musk did mention Dogecoin during his SNL appearance, the rally in anticipation of his appearance was a classic example of “buy the rumor, sell the news”—the DOGE price saw a steep correction in the following week.

Elon Musk and DOGE development

Elon Musk has been involved with Dogecoin beyond just mentioning the cryptocurrency in his tweets. According to Musk, he has been in touch with Dogecoin developers, discussing ways of how Dogecoin could be improved to be a more efficient tool for payments.

In May 2021, reports came out revealing that Elon Musk first got in touch with Dogecoin developers in 2019. Musk himself has also stated that he was working with Dogecoin developers to “improve system transaction efficiency”.

Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2021

Elon Musk has also had interactions with Dogecoin’s founders Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. Palmer has become a vocal critic of cryptocurrency and has expressed annoyance about his name being permanently associated with Dogecoin, while Markus seems to be more positive on the subject. Palmer has openly expressed his dislike for Musk, and the two had a spat on Twitter after Palmer called Elon Musk a “grifter” in an interview. On the other hand, Markus and Musk appear to be on good terms.

How much Dogecoin does Elon Musk have?

It’s currently unclear how much Dogecoin Elon Musk owns. Some users have claimed that the largest Dogecoin wallet, which at some point held close to 30% of the total DOGE supply, belongs to Musk. However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.

Does Elon Musk still hold Dogecoin?

Yes, Elon Musk most likely still holds Dogecoin. In March 2022, Elon Musk said “I still own & won’t sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge”. In June 2022, Elon Musk stated: “I will keep supporting Dogecoin”. So, while we can’t say with absolute certainty that Musk still owns DOGE, it’s very likely that he does.

What is Elon Musk’s involvement with Dogecoin?

Elon Musk has frequently expressed his support for Dogecoin, which has in some cases also had a noticeable impact on the DOGE market. In addition, Elon Musk has been in touch with Dogecoin’s development team, discussing ideas to improve the energy consumption and efficiency of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.

Which cryptocurrencies does Elon Musk hold?

Elon Musk says he holds Dogecoin, Bitcoin and Ethereum. As of March 2022, Musk said that he still held all these three cryptocurrencies. Musk hasn’t mentioned owning any other cryptocurrencies.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxOTI3L2Vsb24tbXVzay1kb2dlY29pbi_SATpodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTkyNy9lbG9uLW11c2stZG9nZWNvaW4v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-24,Find Exactly the NFT You Want on Binance NFT - CoinCodex,"NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are one of the best examples of crypto and blockchain technology gaining mainstream adoption. NFTs can be used to represent both digital and physical artworks, digital collectibles like sports player cards, avatars used in online worlds, and so much more.

If you’re interested in NFTs, the easiest way to get started is to go to an NFT marketplace and explore the different NFTs that are available. If you want to buy and collect NFTs, you’ll also have to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that supports the blockchain network of the NFT in question.

In this article, we’ll be taking a look at Binance NFT, which is a fully-featured NFT marketplace launched by Binance. Binance is the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of user count and volume, and it’s certainly worth checking out for anyone who’s interested in cryptocurrency and related technology such as NFTs.

More specifically, we will be focusing on how to search NFTs on Binance NFT to find NFTs that we’re interested in. The Binance NFT marketplace provides some very helpful filtering options that make it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for.

The first step is to create an account on Binance. Beyond NFTs, this will also give you access to a plethora of crypto trading services, as well as crypto lending and staking products. Please note that you’ll have to verify your identity before you’re allowed to use Binance services—this is necessary for the exchange to comply with regulations.

Create Binance Account

After your account on Binance is ready, head over to the Binance NFT section and select “Explore”.

You’ll be greeted with a list of NFTs that are available for purchase on Binance NFT. Some will be offered at a fixed price, while others will be sold through an auction.

If you want to organize the NFTs you see, you can select between different sorting options. For example, you can choose to prioritize the most recently listed NFTs or the NFTs with the most favorites. Some of these options are more useful than others. For example, sorting by highest price first isn’t very useful, as some users will list their NFTs at extremely high prices as a way to get attention.

If you really know what you’re looking for, you can simply use the search bar to search for specific NFT collections or creators. For example, here we can see the profile of a creator, where we can find the NFTs they have collected, created and favorited.

Find NFTs by using filters

If you want to get more specific in your search, enable the “Filters” option in towards the top of the interface.

The Binance NFT platform provides multiple filters you can use to narrow down your search.

Type

In this section, you can toggle between seeing NFTs in verified or unverified collections. Binance NFT tags some collections as Verified Collections based on factors such as sales volume, trading volume, and number of social media followers. In other words, a collection needs to have some popularity before it’s tagged as a Verified Collection.

However, the verified tag by itself shouldn’t be interpreted as an endorsement from the platform—you should still do your own research if you’re interested in buying any particular NFT as an investment.

Status

Here, you can select to view collections based on their sale status. There’s four options available:

Buy Now: See NFTs that can be bought immediately for a fixed price

Live Auction: See NFTs that are currently being sold through an auction

Has Offers: See NFTs that have at least one buy offer

Coming Soon: See NFTs that will be available for purchase soon

Price

The Binance NFT marketplace supports three types of currency. BNB (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD) and Ethereum (ETH). In this section, you can toggle available NFTs based on the currency they’re being sold for. You can also select the minimum and maximum price you’re interested in. For example, you could choose to only view NFTs that are being sold for between 50 BUSD and 100 BUSD.

Collections

In this section, you can limit your search to specific NFT collections. You can manually input the collection’s name, or scroll down the list of available collections.

Here’s an example of using multiple filters to narrow down our search. We’re searching for NFTs that are coming soon, are being sold for at least 2 BNB, and belong to the collection The CR7 NFT Collection.

See the most popular NFTs using the leaderboard

If you go to the “Stats” section of the Binance NFT marketplace, you can explore the most popular NFT collections. The default view is “Top Collections”, which will show you the NFT collections with the highest trading volume in the specified time period. For example, we can see that the most popular NFT collection at the time of writing is Bored Ape Yacht Club, with 1,269 ETH worth of volume in the last 24 hours.

If you’re interested in the leaderboards for a specific blockchain, you can select it in the navigation bar. Currently, the two supported blockchains by Binance NFT are Ethereum and BNB Chain.

In this section, you can also view leaderboards for the top individual NFTs, mystery boxes and creators.

Dive deeper with analytics

If you wish to know more about a specific NFT collection, you can go over to the “Analytics” tab. Here, you will be able to see the collection’s trading volume and the average price of its items, the fluctuation of the collection’s floor price, as well as the range of prices at which items from the collections are available for sale.

The bottom line—find exactly what you’re looking for on Binance NFT

The Binance NFT marketplace provides a wealth of options for finding NFTs. This makes it easy to only focus on NFTs that you’re interested in, or find NFTs that fit your specific criteria. With the leaderboards and analytics sections, you can easily track trends in the NFT markets and see which collections are increasing and volume and floor price, and which collections are falling out of favor with users.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjczL2ZpbmQtZXhhY3RseS10aGUtbmZ0LXlvdS13YW50LW9uLWJpbmFuY2UtbmZ0L9IBVGh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjczL2ZpbmQtZXhhY3RseS10aGUtbmZ0LXlvdS13YW50LW9uLWJpbmFuY2UtbmZ0Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-12,"Tether blacklists $31.4M USDT following FTX’s alleged hack, Musk reacts - Cointelegraph","On the night of Nov. 11, several wallet addresses linked to FTX were found transferring millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies without an official notice — sparking speculations ranging from the commencement of FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings to the involvement of hackers. Within hours, FTX confirmed on Telegram that the fund transfers were part of an ongoing hack.

Following FTX’s confirmation on Telegram about the hack, as shown above, Tether proactively blacklisted $31.4 million worth of Tether (USDT) tokens linked to the transactions. As pointed out by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, the blacklisted USDT tokens were made up of $3.9 million USDT on Avalanche and $27.5 million USDT on Solana.

By blacklisting the alleged stolen USDT token, Tether disarmed hackers from siphoning the assets to another account or exchanging them for other cryptocurrencies. As part of the remediation, Tether can burn the blacklisted USDT and reissue equal amounts of the asset to the original owner.

However, the hacker also stole numerous other crypto assets, including Ether (ETH), Chainlink (LINK) and Pax Dollar (USDP), which is yet to see intervention from respective ecosystems.

2022-12-07,"LAND Sales for GensoKishi, a Popular Metaverse MMORPG Game, Coming in December - CoinCodex","Key highlights:

GensoKishi Online-Meta World, a play-to-earn blockchain-powered MMORPG game, was released on 30 November.

Bringing the universe of Elemental Knights to the 3D metaverse map, GensoKishi will hold a land sale event in December.

The project, which also allows the creation of in-game NFT items with UGC, offers many methods of earning income by purchasing land.

GensoKishi Metaverse is a comprehensive GameFi project that presents an elaborate 3D MMORPG universe and empowers its ecosystem with native MV tokens and NFTs. The project, inspired by the mobile multiplayer game Elemental Knights Online, which has a huge player base of over 8 million gamers, transferred the popular in-game universe to the Polygon (MATIC) blockchain.

GensoKishi offers both a simple gaming experience that anyone can play with their desktop or mobile device, as well as economic and earning opportunities for the game. The project has adopted the play-to-earn concept, which is frequently preferred in the metaverse field. Rare NFTs released via online auction will form the basis of the GensoKishi universe.

GensoKishi released in late November, after an NFT presale that sold out in under 7 minutes

GensoKishi Online - Meta World was officially released on November 30th. The new Web3 version of the game allows NFT trading of in-game items and avatars for immersion in the metaverse. The MV token, the game’s native digital assets, powers this fantasy universe. The in-game currency can be converted to ROND, the cryptocurrency released by Genso, and listed on Bybit. This means that the in-game money obtained by playing the game can simply be converted into fiat currency, which we’ve seen in numerous Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming titles over the course of the past couple of years.

Your avatar determines your appearance in the Metaverse. Avatar NFTs, called cosplay NFTs, have also witnessed valuable collaborations with prominent game designers, such as Yoshitaka Amano, for instance. On November 20th, the GensoKishi team held an NFT presale in collaboration with Amano, which saw a great deal of success as the entire collection sold out in under 7 minutes.

Players spread across the globe can easily interact with each other in the metaverse. Users who defeat monsters by entering dungeons with their friends enjoy spending time together in the same online environment.

Any player must be strategically equipped with optimally powered NFT weapons to attack monsters in various dungeons. Users destroy monsters by attacking them in their own way, as finding the right balance between a methodical approach and fast-paced teamwork is mandatory.

Future updates to GensoKishi

The GensoKishi team has a number of updates in the pipeline that are aimed at improving the gaming experience, and enriching the platform with additional features. Some of them include:

Housing (design your own house)

NFT rental

Mall space increase

NFT trading between users

The Dragon Tower (PvP challenge dungeon)

New collaboration NFTs

UGC: Import of user-designed items and avatars into the game

Many celebrities and brands join the Genso metaverse

Supported devices

You can experience the metaverse fun at its best by playing GensoKishi Online - Meta World on WebGLs (Windows, MacOS) and mobile devices (Android, iOS).

Land Sale expected in December

The functionality of the GensoKishi game continued to be developed throughout the alpha and beta versions with the participation of the community. Various functions such as importing and exporting NFT/FTs continue to be updated as well. After the LAND sales scheduled for December, users will be able to design their own maps and kingdoms with the UGC function. LAND Viewer will also be released in December, allowing users to view the distribution of LANDs across many regions of the Genso universe. Moreover, Genso will gift 1x1 LAND to 3 people in the community to celebrate the launch of LAND.

Land types

The GensoKishi map has a total of 400 x 400 (160,000) plots, and the LANDs are of three different types. The names of the species that vary according to the size of the plots are LAND, ESTATE, and LANDMARK.

LAND can be used as a studio to hold a special exhibition, a space to get together with friends, a stand for advertising activities, or a space to build your own home and outfit it with NFT furniture items. This field of a 1x1 plot can be expanded using the $MV token.

ESTATE, on the other hand, is a medium-sized parcel of land that is generally expected to be used for commercial use and can be used to build RPG castles, dungeons, and similar structures. Users can build medium-sized structures here. Its dimensions are 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.

LANDMARK is the largest land allocation in the Genso Metaverse and is the capital of a single region. A huge data capacity is given to LANDMARKs, and LANDMARK owners can freely express their worldview in these areas. Even the name of the owner of LANDMARK is recorded in the metadata of the corresponding LAND_NFT. Its dimensions are 3x3, 4x4, 8x8 and 12x12.

The sale of the lands will be conducted in December, and the sale price and sales quantity will be announced soon.

How do you earn money when you own a Land?

Landowners have the opportunity to earn money by running many types of businesses. Monetization mechanics are usually related to NFTs that are tokenized and brought into play with UGC.

Anyone can host live concert events, fan clubs, and birthday parties in their own LAND.

If your LAND becomes a popular destination, you can generate affiliate income by posting banners and videos and setting up sponsored stands.

RPGs compatible with GensoKishi Online can be created in lands.

It is possible to earn income as a builder or to earn rent as a land owner. Buildings and land with increased value can also be sold as capital.

As a 3D building builder, you can earn money by constructing buildings for companies.

NFT items can be created and sold using UGC. These can be trendy equipment, apartment costumes, furniture, in-game items, or more.

Rare loot from GensoKishi Online's quests can be displayed in the LAND, traded and sold to prospective buyers, or used as a treasure item to showcase the user's achievements.

Campaign organized in partnership with Ledger

New stores are opening in the famous Genso Mall of GensoKishi Metaverse. Ledger, the world's most famous hardware wallet manufacturer, is one of the brands that opened a store in the mall. In Genso Metaverse, which targets millions of new players to enter the world of Web3 and blockchain, the Ledger store will be the stopping point for those who want to educate themselves about hardware wallets and blockchain security.

Ledger has also created an in-game item NFT called ""Ledger Nano Sword"". The first 80 people to purchase this item will receive a Ledger Nano X in collaboration with Genso.

Final thoughts

Metaverse projects that create virtual lands, allow building on them, enable in-game NFT item creation, and provide space to both improve online forms of interaction and create a digital economy hold great potential for the future. GensoKishi adds 3D gamification skills to all of these.

GensoKishi is getting ready to launch a land sale after witnessing many improvements and improvements since its beta launch.

2022-11-14,Trust Wallet Token Price Surges +100% as Binance CEO Highlights Importance of Crypto Self-Custody - CoinCodex,"Key takeaways:

Trust Wallet Token (TWT), the native asset of a popular self-custody wallet solution, rallied over +100% in the past couple of days

TWT reached its new all-time high after Binance CEO made comments about the importance of self-custody in crypto

TWT is trading at $2.71 – its highest price on record – at press time

Trust Wallet Token (TWT) hits a new all-time high after CZ’s self-custody comments

With most cryptocurrency assets still reeling from last week’s FTX collapse, Trust Wallet Token (TWT) has been ignoring the broader market trend in a big way. Earlier today, the native asset of the decentralized blockchain wallet reached a new all-time high of $2.71 on the heels of more than $584 million in 24-hour trading volume. For context, the market cap of all TWT tokens in circulation is roughly $1.1 billion.

The price of the Trust Wallet Token stood at around $1.23 on November 12. Just 48 hours later, TWT’s price surpassed the $2.70 level and is showing more than a +100% price change at the time of writing. The recent surge in the price of TWT has propelled the self-custody wallet project into the top 40 largest crypto projects by market capitalization.

The extremely positive price activity follows a tweet made by Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao on Monday, who mentioned Trust Wallet, Binance's official digital wallet partner, as a potential solution for users who are looking to store crypto themselves.

We are not just a CEX. We offer choices.



Store crypto yourself? Read this article I wrote from 2 years ago. The 15 minutes read will save you money and headache later. @TrustWallet



Read the same article if you use a CEX, too. @binancehttps://t.co/Kp6VeKirgZ — CZ ? Binance (@cz_binance) November 13, 2022

Zhao recommended users start with small amounts when first trying out self-custody products since mistakes “can be very costly.” He added:

“Self custody is a fundamental human right. You are free to do it at any time. Just make sure you do do it right.”

When using Trust Wallet, crypto wallet users are responsible for the safekeeping of their own private keys, which allows for the true ownership of crypto assets, unlike storing assets on cryptocurrency exchanges which essentially relinquishes ownership of assets.

In related Trust Wallet news, the wallet provider launched a new browser extension for Chrome, Brave, and Opera earlier today. According to the press release, the extension complements the company’s mobile wallet solution, which has been downloaded over 60 million times and features more than 10 million monthly active users.

Other wallet tokens have also been displaying strong price performance

Trust Wallet Token is not the only native asset of a digital wallet solution that has been trending upward after the collapse of FTX. With an increasing number of users looking for self-custody solutions to store their crypto assets, a number of wallet tokens have rallied by high double digits in the past week.

BlockWallet (BLANK) leads gains with a 7-day price upswing of more than +138%, followed by Trust Wallet's TWT, which we've extensively covered in this article.

2022-11-27,Rocketize Could Be The Next Meme Cryptocurrency To Surpass Crypto Heavyweights Avalanche And Unus Sed Leo - CoinCodex,"Rocketize Could Be The Next Meme Cryptocurrency To Surpass Crypto Heavyweights Avalanche And Unus Sed Leo

Every cryptocurrency trader is constantly looking for the next big cryptocurrency, and many have set their sights on a new dog-themed meme cryptocurrency, Rocketize (JATO).

One group of cryptocurrencies that have provided enormous yield for holders is meme cryptocurrencies, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) leading the way.

These dog-themed meme cryptocurrencies dominate the cryptocurrency market, outperforming established and successful cryptocurrencies, Avalanche (AVAX) and Unus Sed Leo (LEO).

But can Rocketize (JATO) follow the legacy of its meme coin pace-setters? This article explores the successes of Avalanche (AVAX) and Unus Sed Leo (LEO) and how Rocketize (JATO) can surpass them, like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

Avalanche, Ethereum’s Top Contender

Avalanche (AVAX) has gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency market since its launch in 2020, establishing an outstanding and notable reputation among crypto enthusiasts.

Many analysts and experts regard Avalanche (AVAX) as one of Ethereum’s (ETH) top competitors, with the crypto platform well-positioned to offer an Ethereum-alternative blockchain. To do this, Avalanche (AVAX) focuses on speed and scalability, leveraging sharding technology to achieve its goal.

The cryptocurrency ranks 18th by market cap in the cryptocurrency market, amassing a market value of over $4 billion at the time of writing.

Unus Sed Leo Offers Huge Returns To Its Users

Unus Sed Leo (LEO) is the native currency of the iFinex network, the parent company of Bitfinex. As a result, it facilitates various discounts to Bitfinex users, including lending, trading, withdrawal, and deposit fee discounts.

With a cross-chain capability, Unus Sed Leo (LEO) is accessible on both the EON and Ethereum blockchains. Thanks to this capability, users can take advantage of all the LEO token's advantages across several blockchains. The EON blockchain also helps the LEO token process transactions faster.

Unus Sed Leo (LEO) represents a great buy, thanks to the rapidly expanding iFinex ecosystem. The cryptocurrency currently ranks 20th by market cap, with a market valuation of over $3.6 billion at the time of writing.

Rocketize, The Newest Meme Currency

The new cryptocurrency, Rocketize (JATO), is more than just a meme coin. Rocketize (JATO) combines the best of two significant niches into a single feature.

As a meme coin, Rocketize (JATO) enables cryptocurrency users to have fun while benefiting from everything that a meme coin offers blockchain technology.

Additionally, Rocketize (JATO) guarantees its users the benefits of the decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Like many other tokens, Rocketize (JATO) can be used to create smart contracts and support decentralized apps.

Furthermore, many transactions may be processed quickly and effectively using the Rocketize (JATO) network. The crypto platform leverages its Binance Smart Chain (BSC) infrastructure to deliver reduced transaction fees.

Given the unique characteristics of Rocketize (JATO), it is understandable why so many traders are scrambling to include the cryptocurrency in their portfolios.

Currently, on pre-sale, interested buyers can purchase the cryptocurrency and earn exciting rewards and bonuses.

Conclusion

Avalanche (AVAX) and Unus Sed Leo (LEO) are already in the top 20 as they deliver viable solutions for ever-growing challenges in blockchain technology. However, Rocketize (JATO) aims to surpass them in the cryptocurrency market while becoming the largest meme crypto with its use cases and future programs.

Data-driven conclusions: Encouraging Ethereum stats after the Merge

The October Ethereum analysis continues to reflect the impact of the Ethereum blockchain transition to a Proof of Stake system. Thus, the number of blocks per day has increased, as well as their size. At the same time, the activity of the network as a whole increased, as the price of gas increased despite the fundamental decline in the price of gas after the Merge.

The number of new smart contracts on the Ethereum network has also grown - this is a good sign. However, the number of active wallets and smart contracts continues to decline. This means that only the most persistent remain on the market, and the activity of specific users is growing day by day, which can positively affect the market, which is simply tired of looking down.

Ethereum’s price saw mostly sideways movement during October, with ETH/USD trading flat for the better part of the month. However, it is worth noting that ETH’s price saw a significant move to the top in the final week of October, reaching a peak of $1,640 on October 29. At press time, the market capitalization of Ethereum stands at roughly $198 billion.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwODE3L2V0aGVyZXVtLWFuYWx5c2lzLW9jdC0yMDIyL9IBQmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwODE3L2V0aGVyZXVtLWFuYWx5c2lzLW9jdC0yMDIyLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-16,"With Big Eyes Coin as an Inspiration, Meme Coins May Have the Chance to Overthrow Solana and Filecoin - CoinCodex","Finding a sustainable and stable cryptocurrency is hard work and this is why altcoins are stepping up their game to include more perks in their blockchains that will attract enthusiasts. The winter market is weighing down on a lot of people and alternatives are being sought after. Big Eyes Coin (BIG) came into the market at the right time to salvage the ruins that this crypto winter has caused.

Being a meme coin, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) hopes to offer some sort of comic relief amidst the storm that has hit the market. With cuteness and a strong agenda, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) intends to be the first choice of individuals seeking to make a migration from forerunner coins to novel altcoins.

The Big Eyes project has put together diverse approaches to facilitate its seamless move into the industry. Some of these plans have already been set in motion and judging from the successful presale, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) might just be what the crypto doctor has prescribed instead of Solana (SOL) and Filecoin (FIL).

Can Big Eyes Coin (BIG) Overtake Bitcoin (BTC)?

Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is a meme coin that relies on its community for visibility and growth. Like other meme coins, the success of a project depends on the hype around it and Big Eyes seems to be getting a lot of that lately. The project started its pre-sale a while back and is close to making $10 million and it is currently in its 6th stage. Big Eyes is moving at a fast pace and crypto analysts believe that it can be a game-changer in the crypto industry. Its presence in the meme community has started the redemption process of this overlooked aspect of the crypto market.

Although Bitcoin (BTC) remains the giant of cryptocurrency, there have been several predictions that suggest that Big Eyes may replace Bitcoin (BTC). While this has been regarded as a reach, it is not far-fetched as some notable currencies such as Ethereum have come close to usurping power from Bitcoin and while they didn’t take over, they remain top-tier currencies. Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is not just after profits as it plans on giving back to society. 5% of BIG tokens have been reserved for this cause. During NFT events, individuals will have the opportunity to win rewards and giveaways.

Access Blockchain Interaction with Solana (SOL)

Solana is an open-source platform that plans to achieve complete interoperability without losing decentralization. This network also intends to become the primary blockchain for modern internet applications, utilizing its native token, Solana (SOL). Solana uses a hybrid consensus mechanism – Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) – to achieve high throughput.

With this hybrid technology, Solana can turn out 700,000 transactions per second and this makes it one of the most scalable blockchains in the crypto market. Solana uses Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) to improve its efficiency. Solana stands out from other coins by making use of Rust instead of Solidity as its technical foundation. The Solana (SOL) token is used for transaction fees and staking.

Filecoin (FIL) Helps to Keep Users' Information Safe

Filecoin is a decentralized network that aims to keep its users’ data safe without the fear of hacks or leaks. Using its native cryptocurrency, FIL, Filecoin allows users to store their data at extremely low prices. Due to Filecoin being a decentralized network, there is no need for a different API to be built for each network provider on the platform.

Due to its success so far, Filecoin (FIL) has bagged sponsorships from organizations such as Ausum Ventures, Blockchain Capital, and Pantera Capital. Filecoin creates a broader free market for data storage to reduce transaction fees. This implies that several users will contribute to the massive storage network.

For bonus tokens use the code BIGE481 when you make your Big Eyes Coin purchase.

2022-11-21,Trust Wallet Token Earns #1 Spot as Non-Custodial Wallets Gain Popularity—Top 3 Coins to Watch for Nov 21—Nov 27 - CoinCodex,"The crypto and blockchain space is still in the midst of the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, the full consequences of which are yet to unravel. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the three most interest cryptocurrencies to follow this week.

3. dYdX Token (DYDX)

dYdX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that offers advanced functionality such as derivatives trading. The protocol also supports leveraged trading, allowing users to amplify their buying power by up to 20x on certain products. The exchange supports trading for more than 30 different assets, and uses a Layer 2 solution from StarkWare to make it possible for users to trade without paying any gas fees.

dYdX launched their DYDX governance token in August of 2021, and distributed tokens to users of the protocol through a “retroactive airdrop”. DYDX gives holders the ability to influence the development of the protocol, and the token is also used for staking in a Safety Pool that serves as a safety net in case the protocol becomes insolvent or faces other risks.

Why dYdX Token? Users bet on DEXes in the wake of FTX collapse

The collapse of FTX continues to command practically all of the crypto community’s attention. The exchange’s mishandling of customer funds has provided another example of how trusting centralized exchanges with cryptocurrency can have disastrous consequences.

The original ethos of cryptocurrency is for coin holders to have full control of their funds—the only way to move cryptocurrency is for the holder to sign a transaction using their private key. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXes) build on this foundation, and provide a way for users to exchange between different crypto assets entirely through smart contracts, without the requirement of trust in any middlemen such as centralized exchanges.

With this context in mind, it’s probably worth keeping an eye on the tokens connected to various DEXes. One token that has benefited from the FTX situation is DYDX, the token used by the dYdX decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. In comparison to DEXes like Uniswap, which only offers simple token swaps, the dYdX platform provides cryptocurrency derivatives, which can be traded with leverage. This potentially makes dYdX a more appealing platform for traders who have been disillusioned by the collapse of FTX.

2. XRP (XRP)

XRP is a cryptocurrency that was launched in June of 2012. It was developed by David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto, who started a company called OpenCoin together with Chris Larsen. 80% of the XRP supply was gifted to the company by the developers of XRP. OpenCoin has since been renamed to Ripple, and the company has put the majority of its XRP holdings into escrow.

XRP provides very fast and low-cost transfers, making it suitable for use-cases like remittances. It uses neither Proof-of-Work nor Proof-of-Stake, but instead implements the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. Every participant in the XRP network can choose a set of validators that they trust to behave honestly.

Ripple has implemented the XRP cryptocurrency into its products, most notably On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). ODL works in partnership with cryptocurrency exchanges uses XRP to provide efficient cross-border money transfers.

Why XRP? A new development in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit

The lawsuit between the U.S. SEC and Ripple is still the main narrative surrounding the XRP cryptocurrency. The judge presiding over the SEC vs Ripple case has recently granted the motions of Coinbase, Blockchain Association, and over a dozen other parties to file amicus curiae briefs. These are documents that can be presented to a court by a party that is not part of the legal case, but can provide relevant information or expertise to help the court reach a verdict. This could be another step closer to the resolution of the lawsuit, which is weighing down the markets for XRP.

In addition, Ripplehas recently announced a partnership with leading African fintech MFS Africa. Per the announcement, the partnership will streamline real-time mobile payments in 35 countries. The partnership will incorporate Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which utilizes the XRP cryptocurrency to facilitate fast and efficient payments.

Trust Wallet Token (TWT)

Trust Wallet Token is a token created by Trust Wallet, a popular non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet owned by Binance. Trust Wallet describes TWT as a utility token, as holding the token provides a variety of perks for Trust Wallet users.

For example, holders of TWT are eligible for discounts when purchasing cryptocurrency through the Trust Wallet app, or making token swaps through the wallet’s decentralized exchange integrations. An additional utility of TWT is that token holders can participate in decisions related to Trust Wallet, for example by voting to support or disapprove planned updates.

TWT is available on the BNB Chain blockchain platform as a BEP-20 standard token. Initially, TWT was launched in March 2020 on the Ethereum blockchain.

Why Trust Wallet Token? Users flock to non-custodial solutions following FTX fiasco

The sudden and unexpected collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange has reinvigorated interest in non-custodial cryptocurrency storage solutions, which don’t rely on trusting any third parties for managing private keys. There’s many non-custodial cryptocurrency available to users, including software and hardware wallets.

Trust Wallet, which is available both as a mobile app and as a browser extension, is one of the most popular software non-custodial wallets. One of the main reasons for the popularity of Trust Wallet is the wallet’s versatility, as it supports 65 different blockchain platforms. In addition, the wallet can serve as an on-ramp into the cryptocurrency market, as users can purchase cryptocurrencies with a credit or debit card. Trust Wallet also provides a DApp (decentralized application) browser, and integrates token swapping through decentralized exchanges.

The TWT token has seen a big price spike recently. On November 12, the token was changing hands at about $1.17. By November 14, TWT reached a local peak of $2.68, achieving a new all-time high. With the TWT price currently around its all-time highs, it will be fascinating to see if the token can keep going higher or whether a price correction is in play.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2NvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTM5MS90cnVzdC13YWxsZXQtdG9rZW4tZWFybnMtMS1zcG90LWFzLW5vbi1jdXN0b2RpYWwtd2FsbGV0cy1nYWluLXBvcHVsYXJpdHl0b3AtMy1jb2lucy10by13YXRjaC1mb3Itbm92LTIxbm92LTI3L9IBlQFodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTM5MS90cnVzdC13YWxsZXQtdG9rZW4tZWFybnMtMS1zcG90LWFzLW5vbi1jdXN0b2RpYWwtd2FsbGV0cy1nYWluLXBvcHVsYXJpdHl0b3AtMy1jb2lucy10by13YXRjaC1mb3Itbm92LTIxbm92LTI3Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-16,Web3 community shares tips for a successful GameFi project - Cointelegraph,"As the GameFi space continues its journey to attract gamers to a new gaming paradigm, community members shared their takes on what they think a mature GameFi project needs to succeed.

One Redditor suggested that GameFi projects need to appeal to several target audiences, including whales, who will provide funding; earners, who are mostly kids and people from developing countries; and those who play for fun, who will leave good reviews for the game.

Another community member pointed out the need to improve the reputation of the space. According to the Redditor, some consider GameFi a scam — and this needs to be changed. In addition, the community member also highlighted that it would help if GameFi projects held e-sports competitions with high prize pools as rewards.

Meanwhile, one user said that a matured GameFi project must have a way to make its token relevant for gamers. This suggests that further use cases must be added. In addition, the user also suggested integrating decentralized finance liquidity mining for the tokens.

Going back to the basics of gaming, another community member believes that the most important factor GameFi projects should focus on is making the game fun and engaging, which will make users come back “day in and day out.”

Investors appear to be preoccupied with the final match of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, as the cryptocurrency market is devoid of volatility on Sunday. Given this, the Bitcoin price prediction hasn't changed much throughout the day, as BTC remains above the important support level of $16,550.

Following the collapse of FTX and concerns that Binance is in jeopardy, most crypto trading platforms are holding payments due to liquidity concerns.

Giant DCG Locked Nearly $300 Million in Crypto Amid Liquidity Issues

Bitvavo, a cryptocurrency trading platform based in the Netherlands, claims that Digital Currency Group (DCG) is holding back hundreds of millions of dollars owing to liquidity concerns.

Bitvavo has announced in a recent statement that DCG, which offers off-chain staking services to Bitvavo, has suspended repayments until the company's current liquidity situation is resolved. Bitvavo maintains that the problems being experienced by DCG will not affect its service in any way.

Bitvavo claims that the problems DCG is experiencing will not affect its service in any way.

“DCG is currently experiencing liquidity problems due to the current turbulence in the crypto market. As a result, DCG has suspended repayments until this liquidity issue has been resolved…

According to Bitvavo, which oversees €1.6 billion in crypto assets, DCG will eventually repay its debt of roughly $280 million. The cryptocurrency exchange also notes that it will not be restricting withdrawals for customers due to DCG's default.

The market's ongoing fear is keeping Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under pressure.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

The current Bitcoin price is $16,747, and the 24-hour trading volume is $11 billion. Bitcoin has fallen by 0.10% in the previous 24 hours. CoinMarketCap now ranks first, with a live market cap of $322 billion. It has a total quantity of 21,000,000 BTC coins and a circulating supply of 19,236,818 BTC coins.

On Sunday, the BTC/USD is expected to locate initial support near $16,560. With RSI and MACD in the oversold zone, BTC prices could surge to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $17,000.

Up forward, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement point and the 50-day simple moving average at $17,250 will act as new resistance for the BTC/USD pair. However, if BTC prices drop below $16,570, the $16,150 support level could become vulnerable.

2022-11-24,Why Binance Margin Is One of the Best Crypto Leverage Trading Platforms - CoinCodex,"Binance Margin is a margin trading platform offered by Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance Margin makes it possible to increase your crypto trading positions by borrowing funds. You have to provide collateral, which is called the margin, in order to be able to borrow. and pay interest on the borrowed funds.

Margin trading is unique because it allows you to access leverage. For example, you could post $1,000 worth of Bitcoin as margin to borrow $2,000 worth of funds. Now, you can enter a position with $2,000 in capital instead of $1,000. In this example, you would be using 2:1 (or 2x) leverage. You can borrow higher multiples of your initial margin, but this increases the risk you’re taking on. On Binance Margin, you can access up to 10x leverage when margin trading, assuming you’re using the Isolated Margin mode.

Trade on Binance Margin

With margin trading, you can enter either long or short positions. If you go long on a cryptocurrency, you are predicting that the price will increase, while you would enter a short position if you’re predicting that a cryptocurrency’s price would decrease. The ability to go short is a very useful aspect of margin trading, and opens up new trading strategies that are difficult to execute otherwise.

A simple margin trading example

Let’s take a look at a simple example to illustrate the basic idea behind margin trading. We’ll be ignoring interest payments in this example to make the profit/loss calculation more straightforward.

Let’s say that Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading at $20,000 and we have $1,000 that we want to use to buy Bitcoin. We use the funds to buy 0.05 BTC, and the price of BTC then increases to $22,000. We decide that’s good enough for us, and sell the BTC, receiving $1,100 for a total profit of $100.

If we used leverage in the same scenario, our profits would be bigger. Let’s say that we use our $1,000 as margin to borrow $2,000, using it to purchase Bitcoin. We now have 0.10 BTC. We decide to sell after the price of Bitcoin reaches $22,000, receiving $2,200. After returning the borrowed funds, we’re left with $1,200 and a total profit of $200.

Now, let’s assume a scenario where Bitcoin is trading at $20,000, but drops to $18,000 afterwards. We use $1,000 to buy 0.05 BTC. After the price drops to $18,000, we decide that a further price drop is likely, so we sell our Bitcoin and receive $900. Our total loss in this scenario is $100.

If we used leverage, our loss would be bigger. Let’s say that we use our $1,000 as margin to borrow $2,000 and purchase 0.10 BTC. We decide to get out of the trade when the price of Bitcoin drops to $18,000 and receive $1,800. After returning the borrowed funds, we’re left with $800 and a total loss of $200.

Why is Binance Margin unique?

Binance has gone to great lengths to develop their margin trading platform and arguably make it the industry standard. Here’s a few reasons why Binance Margin stands above most other crypto margin trading products.

Hundreds of cryptocurrencies to choose from

One of the absolute best aspects of Binance Margin is that you can use it to trade an extremely large selection of cryptocurrencies. Typically, exchanges that allow you to trade crypto with leverage only offer this feature for a handful of coins. Binance Margin, on the other hand, allows you to trade hundreds of different cryptocurrencies. Here are just a few examples of the coins you can trade on Binance Margin:

The platform’s support for so many different coins means that you can trade almost any relevant currency with leverage. While I tend to stick to larger coins, there’s often short-term opportunities in the altcoin markets where the ability to access leverage is very useful.

Isolated and cross margin

Another reason Binance Margin stands out to me is that it provides both isolated and cross margin trading modes, while many other platforms only offer one or the other.

I personally prefer isolated margin because I find that it is more intuitive and also gives me more peace of mind—I can keep each position isolated instead of worrying about a worst-case scenario in which a trade going horribly wrong wipes out my whole margin portfolio. Isolated margin also has the option of higher leverage (3x, 5x, or 10x, depending on the trading pair). Of course, cross margin can also be a great option, if you’re comfortable with it.

Binance’s SAFU Fund

The Binance exchange has an emergency fund called SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users), which is designed to protect users during extreme situation. As of November 2022, Binance had $1 billion worth of funds in SAFU.

The SAFU fund provides some reassurance that users who trust Binance with their funds will be able to get something back even if there’s unexpected events like cyber attacks. This is especially important in the aftermath of the collapse of the FTX exchange, which has shaken users’ trust in the cryptocurrency industry.

Why use Binance Margin?

One of the contexts where margin trading can come in handy when the cryptocurrency markets are not very volatile—by using leverage, it’s possible to make meaningful profits even if the price moves themselves are not very large.

In a lot of ways, margin trading is also more intuitive than derivatives trading. When trading derivatives, you’re actually trading a contract, and you have to track the funding rate if you’re using perpetual futures contracts. Meanwhile, margin trading is very similar to spot trading, except that you’re using borrowed funds in order to leverage your positions.

Since you have to pay interest daily when you borrow funds for margin trading, I wouldn’t recommend using margin trading for long-term positions. Instead, margin trading is best suited for opportunistic, short-term trades. That way, you’ll avoid losing too much value to interest payments.

It’s important to be careful

Cryptocurrency trading is risky by itself, since the crypto markets are highly volatile—substantial losses can happen quickly even if you’re not using leverage. It’s important to understand that trading with leverage is a double-edged sword, as both the potential profits and losses are bigger. The more leverage you use, the more risk you are taking on. Never invest more than you’re willing to lose.

Due to the high risk / high reward nature of margin trading, some people might develop unhealthy habits. For example, someone could lose money in a risky trade, and then immediately enter an even riskier trade in an attempt to “win it all back”. This usually ends very poorly, and can lead to a downward spiral with massive losses.

Binance Margin has select features that encourage users to trade responsibly. Users are required to demonstrate basic knowledge of margin trading before they’re able to use the feature, and the platform also offers a “Cooling-Off Period” feature where users can disable access to margin trading for a specified period of time. For example, if you activate a Cooling-Off Period for one week, you will not be able to access margin trading for one week. This feature can protect users from making impulsive decisions.

The bottom line

If you want to trade crypto with leverage, it’s hard to go wrong with Binance Margin. The platform supports hundreds of different cryptocurrencies, relatively high leverage (up to 10x), and provides both cross margin and isolated margin modes so you can fine-tune your risk management.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjc1L3doeS1iaW5hbmNlLW1hcmdpbi1pcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWJlc3QtY3J5cHRvLWxldmVyYWdlLXRyYWRpbmctcGxhdGZvcm1zL9IBb2h0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjc1L3doeS1iaW5hbmNlLW1hcmdpbi1pcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWJlc3QtY3J5cHRvLWxldmVyYWdlLXRyYWRpbmctcGxhdGZvcm1zLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Five Things to Look for in a Good Crypto Sign-Up Offer

When looking for a good crypto sign-up offer, you should keep a few things in mind. First and foremost, you want to ensure that the request is legitimate and that it's not a scam. There are a lot of scams out there, so you need to be careful. Secondly, you want to ensure that the offer is for a currency you're interested in. There are a lot of different cryptocurrencies out there, and not all of them are created equal. Make sure the offer is for a currency you think has potential. Thirdly, you want to ensure that the offer is for a reasonable amount. Many offers out there are for tiny amounts, and while they may be legitimate, they're not going to do much for you in the long run. Look for an offer that's for a decent amount of money so you can start trading immediately. Fourthly, you want to ensure that the terms and conditions are reasonable. A lot of offers will have unreasonable terms and conditions, so be sure to read through them carefully before signing up. Finally, you want to ensure that the company behind the offer is reputable. There are a lot of fly-by-night companies out there, and you don't want to get involved with one of them. Please do some research on the company before signing up for their offer.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpdHJhdGVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3AvZ2V0LWZyZWUtY3J5cHRvLXdoZW4teW91LXNpZ24tdXAtZm9yLXRoZXNlLXBvcHVsYXItcGxhdGZvcm1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-11-16,MetaMask Could Soon Launch Its Token Airdrop. Here's How to ... - Crypto Briefing,"Key Takeaways MetaMask seems to be moving toward decentralization, which could suggest that an airdrop is on the horizon.

Using MetaMask in different ways and interacting with ConsenSys-linked projects could help increase your chances of qualifying for the airdrop.

Swapping tokens on MetaMask and using the wallet's new bridge are two activities that could lead to an airdrop in the future.

Share this article URL Copied

Crypto Briefing looks at the various steps MetaMask users can take to boost their chances of qualifying for the wallet’s long-rumored token airdrop.

MetaMask Token Incoming?

MetaMask is the most popular Web3 wallet, and rumors of a potential token airdrop for active users have circulated in the crypto space for years. ConsenSys founder and CEO Joe Lubin has hinted on several occasions that a token is in the works, but the company has not yet shared full details. Interestingly, ConsenSys recently launched its MetaMask Grants DAO, an employee-led initiative to grant funding to developers outside of ConsenSys working on expanding the MetaMask ecosystem. The move could be a hint that the company is looking to decentralize the project.

ConsenSys hit a $7 billion valuation with a $450 million Series D raise in March, which means it could potentially airdrop a handsome sum to users. But since the wallet is broadly used by crypto natives of all stripes, qualifying for the airdrop may not be easy. Here are some steps MetaMask users can take to maximize their chances of receiving the wallet’s token once it’s live.

1. Swap Tokens on MetaMask

If you don’t have a MetaMask wallet, you’ll need to start by creating one. To get started, download the browser extension or mobile app, create a wallet, store your seed phrase in a safe place, and fund your wallet with some ETH.

Swapping tokens on MetaMask is easy. In the main menu, just click on the blue Swap button next to the Buy and Send icons. Trade some ETH for any token of your choosing, but make sure to keep enough ETH in your wallet to pay transaction fees.

2. Use the MetaMask Bridge

MetaMask recently launched a bridge to let users move funds from one blockchain to another. Connect your wallet to the MetaMask bridge, select Ethereum as your first network, choose another network to send to (you can choose between Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain), then bridge over either ETH, MATIC, DAI, USDC, or USDT tokens.

Again, make sure you already have your second network’s native token in your destination wallet to pay for gas fees. Otherwise, a simple solution is to bridge MATIC from Ethereum to Polygon since MATIC is Polygon’s native token.

3. Create a Gnosis Safe Wallet

ConsenSys and Gnosis Safe announced a partnership in February to increase wallet safety, so MetaMask may reward Gnosis users.

To start using the product, go to Gnosis Safe, connect your wallet, and follow the steps to create a multisig Safe wallet. You’ll need to select Ethereum as the network, name your new wallet, provide at least two addresses as the “owners” of the wallet (you can create a new MetaMask account and input that address alongside the one you’re already using), and pay a small transaction fee.

4. Donate via Gitcoin

ConsenSys has close ties with Gitcoin, as it helped the Ethereum-based donation platform in its early days before it struck out on its own in 2021. Donating to Gitcoin could therefore increase the chances of qualifying for a MetaMask airdrop. To make a donation, you’ll need to create a profile on GitHub, then go to the Gitcoin Grants page, connect your MetaMask, select a Grant project that you like, add it to your cart, go to check out, and choose how much you want to donate (and in which currency). We suggest donating a minimum of $10 as any qualification criteria could have a minimum donation limit to prevent airdrop farming.

5. Sign Up for Infura

ConsenSys acquired Infura in October 2019. Infura is considered one of the world’s leading blockchain infrastructure platforms and it also directly supports MetaMask. Infura is moving toward decentralization and has launched an early access program for community members to help. You can fill out a form on the company’s website to sign up, though Infura is specifically looking for people with experience in blockchain infrastructure. You can also visit ConsenSys’ Discord channel to learn about more ways to get involved.

Final Thoughts

Airdrop hunting is more art than science, and involves an element of luck. Even if you follow all of these steps, it is not guaranteed that you will be able to claim MetaMask tokens once ConsenSys issues them. Some airdrops like Bored Ape Yacht Club’s APE token giveaway were extremely lucrative. Others like Optimism’s OP token distribution were controversial due to their strict qualification criteria. Nevertheless, following the steps listed in this piece is worth the time and effort on the chance they pay off.

2022-12-02,Binance Hires Former Donald Trump Auditors For Proof of Reserves ... - Cryptonews,"Binance Hires Former Donald Trump Auditors For Proof of Reserves Effort

Source: AdobeStock / hamara

Major crypto exchange Binance has appointed the accounting firm Mazars, which worked for former US President Donald Trump’s company, to assist with its Proof of Reserves (PoR) effort.

In order to help assure investors that its coins are covered by reserves, Binance has decided to use Mazars to verify its reserves independently, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a spokesman for the exchange.

The report noted that Binance didn’t specify which of Mazar’s offices would be in charge of doing the reserves verification, while a Mazars spokesperson declined to comment.

According to Bloomberg, quoting a Binance spokesperson,

“Mazars is reviewing all information that we have shared publicly to date on Proof of Reserves (BTC) and will also be verifying future updates and tokens. [...] The first verification update for BTC will be completed this week.”

This is another step in Binance's endeavor to calm down the investors and reassure them that their money is safe with the exchange, and it follows the publication of its PoR on November 11. PoR is meant to allow each investor to check if their holdings are indeed covered by reserves.

As previously reported, Proof of Reserves is an independent audit conducted by a third party meant to ensure that a custodian holds the assets it claims to be holding on behalf of its clients. Various companies have decided to do Proof of Reserves following the FTX collapse and the fear it has created, though notably, some have been doing PoR even before this massive implosion.

You can read more about PoR and the companies already doing it here.

Mazars is an international audit, tax, and advisory firm. Its US arm, Mazars USA, was Trump's longtime accounting firm. However, in February this year, it said that it would cut ties with Trump and his family business, saying that it could no longer stand behind a decade of annual financial statements it prepared for the Trump Organization, The New York Times reported, citing court documents.

2022-11-17,‘Proof of Reserves’ Emerges as a Favored Way to Prevent Another FTX - Yahoo Finance,"Crypto exchange FTX collapsed spectacularly into bankruptcy last week as trust in its accounting for billions of dollars in assets vanished.

In the fiery aftermath, some critics are blasting the very existence of centralized exchanges like Sam Bankman-Fried’s, saying they haven’t been reliable stewards for customers’ assets.

But the blowup has reinvigorated the discussion about a potential solution, something called ""proof of reserves,"" or PoR, a way of showing – with little or no doubt – exactly how many tokens are at any exchange that adopts the technique. If in place at FTX, proof of reserves could have in theory prevented customers’ money from being moved where it shouldn’t have been (to Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda Research).

Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has already shared its wallet balances and says it plans to conduct a proof-of-reserves snapshot “in the next few weeks.” Other exchanges that have made similar commitments include Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit.

Proof of reserves is an auditing technique used to confirm assets on hand. Stablecoin issuers like Paxos use it to prove they have sufficient assets backing their tokens, while exchanges like BitMEX use it to prove customer deposits correspond to assets in custody.

“It would have been a pretty solvable problem if there was more transparency on the balance sheet. We already power multiple stablecoins and multiple gold coins and multiple financial institutions, where we prove their balance sheets through proof of reserves,” Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk in an interview. Nazarov is the co-founder of oracle network Chainlink, which offers a proof-of-reserves product.

How does proof of reserves work?

There are several ways for an entity to prove its asset reserves, from traditional third-party audits by companies like Armanino to ""Merkle tree proofs"" (cryptographic verification via data structures called Merkle trees).

Story continues

Read more: Proof of Reserves: Could It Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?

Then there are methods employed by blockchain analytics companies. Chainlink, for example, separates proof-of-reserves implementation into two categories: off-chain and on-chain.

The off-chain alternative involves a third-party provider like Chainlink receiving API (application programming interface) access from an exchange, its custodian or its auditor to independently verify the exchange’s holdings.





Off-chain proof of reserves (Chainlink)





The on-chain route involves a proof-of-reserves smart contract on one network (usually Ethereum) that receives data feeds (on a block-by-block basis) from Chainlink’s oracle network about a provider’s on-chain wallet balances on another network (e.g., Bitcoin).





On-chain proof of reserves (Chainlink)





Either way, the result is users can verify a company is actually holding the assets it claims to be holding.

Industry experts weigh in

Eric Richmond is a corporate and securities lawyer turned crypto entrepreneur. He founded and ran Tetra Trust, Canada’s first licensed digital-asset custodian in 2019. He is now the chief operating officer at Coinsquare, one of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Coinsquare is a registered investment dealer that reports to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), a self-regulated collection of more than 170 dealers similar to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) in the U.S. Richmond believes while proof of reserves is a step in the right direction, regulation might be a better solution.

“We have an obligation to run daily reports to view our client liabilities versus assets in cold storage,” Richmond explained. “Every single day, we ensure one-to-one in cold storage, which is a requirement of ours under IIROC registration.”

Cold storage means keeping assets offline, not connected to the internet.

Other experts like Nic Carter believe proof of reserves is “the industry’s last hope in terms of making a strong self-regulatory commitment.” Carter is a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, a firm that invests in crypto financial infrastructure.

“Lord knows we need to represent to regulators that we are capable of self-regulation, especially after FTX shattered confidence like this,” Carter told CoinDesk.

“PoR would inhibit situations like Quadriga, FTX or Gox. If any exchange now refuses to do one, I should expect that people will be extremely skeptical of them,"" he said.

In the 2019 collapse of QuadrigaCX, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, it was later revealed its late founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had misappropriated and misused client funds, leaving only a fraction of value behind for its creditors to claim. In the 2014 implosion of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, poor security practices and questionable fund activity resulted in a massive hack. Creditors are still fighting to regain some of those lost funds. The downfall of those platforms, like the collapse of FTX, forced the industry to consider significant improvements to fund and custody management.

Peter Eberle, president and chief investment officer of Castle Funds, a cryptocurrency-focused investment firm, echoed Carter’s comments.

""I believe this will force exchanges to be more transparent. They will need to prove that they are not commingling funds and that they are not lending out customer assets. They will have to earn trust from customers that they actually have the assets that they say they do,” Eberle told CoinDesk. “Audited financial statements, proof of reserves, will be standard going forward. This is something that should always have been the case, but wasn't.""

Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, also agrees the industry needs more transparency. He says his organization has already started to provide attestations.

“This is a matter of self-regulation within the entire industry. In terms of our next steps, we'll look at our internal data, and then find out what kind of data can really reassure our users. And then we'll work with the third parties to disclose data as needed,” Lyu told CoinDesk in an interview. “So far, we've already disclosed information for the bigger and more influential tokens, including ethereum and BTC.”

2022-11-02,How to Stake TRON to Earn Income - CoinCodex,"It is possible to expand a portfolio by increasing interest earned. You can accomplish this by using a method that does not require expensive computers for bitcoin mining, for example. The method is known as staking and is less energy-intensive than mining. With staking, you can also help secure blockchain and the system's infrastructure and make it more secure.

Since the TRON network uses the PoS mechanism, you can stake to earn a 4% annual rate on some crypto platforms. And TRON offers some resources that allow you to pay 0 gas fee. Read on to find out what TRON is, how it works, how to earn TRON, and get resources to make free transfers.

What Is Tron?

The TRON Protocol is one of the largest blockchain-based operating systems in the world. It offers scalable, high-availability, and high-throughput support that serves as the foundation for all decentralized applications (dApps) in the TRON ecosystem. The Tron protocol provides a decentralized way to store and distribute digital content and media and create and manage decentralized applications (dApps).

The network was founded in 2017 by Justin Sun. TRON's network continued to grow in the crypto space, and its mainnet went live in May 2018. In July 2018, BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized services with nearly 100 million active users, was acquired and integrated into the ecosystem. After completing full decentralization, the TRON network became a completely community-governed DAO in December 2021.

TRON is a project with a strong community of developers, content creators, and users working together to create a more decentralized internet. The TRON network is also home to the Tronix (TRX) token, which is used to power the platform and provides an easy way to reward content creators and curators.

TRON uses the TRX token to fuel its ecosystem. It was initially an Ethereum-based token, but that changed after the TRON mainnet went live in 2018. TRON also offers a staking feature, which allows users to earn rewards by holding the token in their wallets.

TRON Use Cases

TRON can be used for the following:

Build a free, global digital entertainment system with distributed storage technology and smart contracts. Develop and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and issue and manage digital assets. The TRON Protocol provides a scalable, decentralized application development platform for blockchain projects. The TRON Virtual Machine (TVM) is a Turing-complete virtual machine that allows developers to deploy smart contracts on the TRON blockchain. Provide a set of APIs that you can use to interact with the blockchain and a wallet SDK that you can use to develop TRON-compatible wallets. Create and manage digital assets, such as tokens, through smart contracts. The TRON Protocol provides a set of built-in token templates that you can use to create different types of tokens, such as utility tokens, currency tokens, and asset-backed tokens. Trade TRON-based tokens using a decentralized exchange. The DEX is powered by the TRON network and does not require a third-party exchange.

TRON Architecture

Data exchange is made possible by the three-layer architecture of the TRON blockchain.

Core layer : Computes Java or Solidity instructions before sending them to the Tron Virtual Machine. The three modules that make up the core layer are the consensus, account management, and smart contract modules.

How Does Tron Staking Work?

TRON staking works by locking up your tokens to receive the best TRON rewards. The more TRX you lock up, the higher the ‘resources’ you will receive to make the gas-free transfer of TRC-20 tokens like TRX, USDT, USDC, etc.

Gasless Transfer With TRON

As mentioned earlier, you can get resources that enable you to make a transfer at zero fees. These resources are known as Bandwidth and Energy. By freezing TRX, you can obtain Bandwidth points. Every 24 hours, the TRON network provides stakers with free Bandwidth points to use for transactions. You can also receive Energy by staking TRX. Based on the amount of TRX staked, all users share a fixed amount of Energy. The network also charges gas fees when you run out of resources.

How to Earn With Tron

The process of staking TRX is relatively simple and can be done in a few steps. To start earning, you first need to have a TRON wallet.

Download the Guarda Wallet app or sign in to a web version. Then, create an account and save the backup. A. Go to the ‘Earn’ section and choose TRON.

Or go on your list and if it is not there, search for it, download the TRX wallet and save the backup. Then, click TRX Wallet, scroll down, and hit the ‘Stake’ button.

If you don’t have any TRX in your wallet, click ‘Buy to stake’ and buy any TRX amount you want. Remember, you need at least 1 TRX to start staking. Next, select the deposit amount and input the amount you want to stake. Also, choose the resources you want to get—energy or bandwidth.

If you are still struggling with understanding energy and bandwidth points, you can read more here

Next, look through the staking information again to ensure you are about to stake the right amount of TRX. Please note that staking requires the network’s bandwidth points. Some of them are given to users when they create a TRX wallet. After that, they can be earned by staking. If everything is alright, confirm staking.

After the confirmation, you will see that your funds have been successfully staked.

You will also see your deposit amount in your wallet. To access your wallet, choose the TRX wallet on the left and go to the ‘Receive’ tab. Remember that your staking amount will be frozen for 3 days. After that, you can unstake your deposit if you’d like by clicking ‘Unstake.’

What Happens When You Unstake TRX?

Unstaking clears the Bandwidth and Energy obtained from staking TRX. All funds are returned to your wallet, and you stop receiving the resources and rewards. There are standard network fees for unstaking paid with bandwidth points or TRX if you are low on bandwidth.

But don’t worry; you can stake it immediately if you wish to restake it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNjk3L2hvdy10by1zdGFrZS10cm9uLXRvLWVhcm4taW5jb21lL9IBSGh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwNjk3L2hvdy10by1zdGFrZS10cm9uLXRvLWVhcm4taW5jb21lLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

A Safemoon investor previously filed a lawsuit alleging the founders and devs of the token indulged in price manipulation and insider trading. The lawsuit claimed that the founders artificially inflated Safemoon’s price by giving false statements. The investor alleged that SFM founders were unlawfully selling the tokens by failing to register them as securities with the SEC. The plaintiff sued the founders in the Utah Federal Court in May this year.

However, the plaintiff seems to have withdrawn and dropped the lawsuit against Safemoon on Friday last week, Bloomberg reported. The news of the lawsuit being dropped made its way into social media bringing in confidence among the investor community.

2022-12-24,Binance Simple Earn—Put Your Crypto to Use and Earn Rewards - CoinCodex,"While cryptocurrency trading can be potentially lucrative, it’s not for everyone. The crypto markets are notoriously volatile and unpredictable, which means that inexperienced traders can be quickly caught off-guard and suffer significant losses. This is the reason why many crypto investors prefer a more passive “buy and HODL” strategy.

Nowadays, even passive crypto investors are able to grow their crypto stash through products such as Binance’s Simple Earn. To be sure, using Simple Earn has less potential upside than active trading. However, the risks are also significantly lower, as you’ll be able to earn additional coins regardless of which direction the cryptocurrency market is heading.

Earn Interest on Your Crypto with Binance Simple Earn

What is Binance Simple Earn?

Simple Earn is a product offered by Binance that allows cryptocurrency holders to deposit their coins and earn yield on their deposit. As one would expect from Binance, the Simple Earn supports a huge variety of cryptocurrencies—you’ll likely find that the coins you hold are supported, whether you invest in large market cap coins or prefer smaller altcoins.

Users can choose between Flexible savings products and Locked savings products. The availability of these products will depend on the coin you want to earn yield on. For example, Binance currently only offers Locked products for BNB, while you can access both Flexible and Locked products for many other coins. At the time of writing, Binance offers more than 300 different products under the Simple Earn umbrella.

As a rule of thumb, Locked products offer higher yields, but also require users to commit their crypto for a certain period of time in order to earn rewards. Flexible products, on the other hand, offer lower yields than Locked products, but you can pull out your funds at any time and keep the rewards you’ve earned. Now, let’s take a closer look at the two types of products offered on Simple Earn.

Flexible products

Flexible products allow you to earn yield on your crypto while having the flexibility of withdrawing your funds at any time. The rewards accrue on a daily basis as long as your crypto is deposited in the Flexible product. Once you want to pull your funds out, you can choose between a fast redemption and a standard redemption.

If you choose the fast redemption, your funds will become available in your Spot Wallet immediately, but you won’t receive any rewards for that day. If you choose the standard redemption, you’ll have to wait until the following day to get your funds in your spot wallet, but you will also earn rewards for the last day of your deposit. So, if you’re not in too much of a hurry, the standard redemption is usually recommended.

Locked products

After subscribing to a locked product, you will need to keep your funds in the product for a set amount of time in order to earn rewards. The main benefit of locked products are higher yields than what’s being offered by flexible products. The longer the lock-up period, the higher the yields usually are.

If you need to immediately access funds you deposited in a locked product, you can do so. However, if you choose to redeem your funds before the end of the lock-up period, you will receive no rewards.

Is Binance Simple Earn right for you?

The Binance Simple Earn product allows crypto holders to earn yield on their coins and tokens. If you’re planning to just hold your cryptocurrency passively and don’t intend to actively trade, Simple Earn can be a great way to grow your crypto stash.

Even though Binance has built up a strong reputation in the crypto community since its launch in 2017, the crypto community has grown more skeptical towards centralized crypto businesses overall following the various scandals we saw in 2022 such as the collapses of FTX, Celsius and Voyager. This has led many crypto investors to switch over to self-custody instead of depositing their funds to a centralized crypto platform.

If you want to use Binance Simple Earn, you will need to deposit your crypto to Binance and trust that it will be handled with care. So, if you prefer to self-custody your crypto, Simple Earn is not the product for you.

On the other hand, if you’re comfortable with holding crypto on a centralized exchange, Simple Earn is a great product that puts your coins to work instead of having them sit idle in your wallet.

Binance Simple Earn pros: Large selection of supported crypto assets

Rewards paid out daily

Grow your crypto holdings regardless of market conditions

Choose between flexible and locked savings products Binance Simple Earn cons: Isn’t suitable for users who want to self-custody their crypto

Binance Simple Earn rewards

When you’re subscribing to a Simple Earn product, you will be presented with an estimated APR (annual percentage rate). However, you have to keep in mind that the actual APR you will be earning will fluctuate depending on market conditions. This applies to both Locked and Flexible savings products.

The displayed APR should be used only as an estimate, as it will change depending on market conditions.

Use Auto-Subscribe to benefit from compound interest

After you subscribe to a product, rewards will start accumulating at 0:00 UTC the next day. After the first full day of the rewards being accrued, you will receive your first rewards to your Spot Wallet on Binance.

By default, the rewards you earn will go to your Spot Wallet, and will not be added to your deposit in the Simple Earn product, but will be separate in your Spot Wallet. This means that you will not be earning compound interest. If you want to compound your rewards, you can do so by using the Auto-Subscribe feature. If you enable this feature, assets from your Spot Wallet will automatically be moved to Simple Earn products.

You can enable Auto-Subscribe on the Simple Earn page by enabling the “Auto-Subscribe” slider.

Subscription caps and Tier Rate

There is a limit on how much crypto a single account can deposit into a Simple Earn product. You can view this limit under “Available Quota” when you’re subscribing to a product. The maximum amount of crypto you can deposit will usually vary depending on whether you’re subscribing to a flexible or locked product.

You also have to be aware of Simple Earn products tagged with “Tier Rate”. In these products, the rewards you will be earning will depend on how much crypto you deposit. When it comes to Tier Rate products, higher APRs are offered for smaller deposits.

The bottom line

Binance Simple Earn excels at providing passive crypto investors an opportunity to slowly grow their holdings over time without worrying about market volatility. Since it provides both Flexible and Locked savings options, users can decide whether they want to prioritize the highest yields or flexibility.

The range of supported crypto assets is another strong point for Binance Simple Earn. The platform supports stablecoins, BTC, ETH, BNB, as well as a host of other cryptocurrencies, providing opportunities for almost all crypto investors.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIyNzQxL2JpbmFuY2Utc2ltcGxlLWVhcm5wdXQteW91ci1jcnlwdG8tdG8tdXNlLWFuZC1lYXJuLXJld2FyZHMv0gFiaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjI3NDEvYmluYW5jZS1zaW1wbGUtZWFybnB1dC15b3VyLWNyeXB0by10by11c2UtYW5kLWVhcm4tcmV3YXJkcy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-25,Will Dogecoin Reach $1? DOGE Price Prediction - CoinCodex,"In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) pulled off one of the most impressive bull stories in crypto history, gaining over +12,000% between the start of the year and its May all-time high peak of $0.738. At the time, many investors were eagerly awaiting the resolution to the question: “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” While it failed to do so in 2021, it showed that Dogecoin can reach 1 dollar, as long as a strong social media push and a broader crypto market upswing are in play.

The history of meme coins started with Dogecoin. When cryptocurrencies were just entering popular consciousness, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer decided to make a parody of Bitcoin (BTC), a token that would show that cryptocurrencies don’t have to be taken so seriously. What started as a joke in December 2013 has grown to become one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap. It has also inspired thousands of other meme coins.

The big break for Dogecoin came in 2021 when its price increased by roughly 3,000% over the course of the year. This was due to support from influential people such as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. Its price performance at the time also helped other meme coins, especially Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, the impressive price performance was not enough to make it worth $1. Its all-time high is $0.738, reached in May last year. But this has not stopped the speculation among many investors that Dogecoin will moon. Here, we discuss Dogecoin's performance history and answer the question, can the Dogecoin price reach $1?

Will Dogecoin reach $1?

There is a possibility for the price of Dogecoin to reach $1 if the previous market performance is anything to judge by. Before 2021, the token existed on the fringes of the crypto space, with only the hard-core community members paying attention to it. It was worth $0.003 in December 2020 and commanded a market capitalization of roughly $370 million. In the span of just one year, it became one of the ten largest crypto projects with a market cap of more than $88 billion.

Suddenly, millions of new investors were looking to buy Dogecoin in hopes of future price increases. It is fair to say, that after the massive bull run, Dogecoin became one of the most popular cryptos in the world, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Certain factors could aid Dogecoin in its quest to reach $1. They include:

Potential Integration on Twitter

Dogecoin saw its price rise by about 100% last month after Elon Musk acquired Twitter, with the speculation growing that he would integrate the currency into the platform. The excellent price performance continued until the report that Twitter had discontinued its crypto wallet project. This shows the impact that a Twitter integration could have on DOGE price. This is especially important because DOGE has little utility presently, and more utility will likely increase its chance of growing up to $1.

Support of Elon Musk

Elon Musk's support was integral to Dogecoin's rise to popularity, and his influence within the community has not diminished. His companies accept Dogecoin for merchandise, and he has promoted it several times. Given his influence and continued and active support for Dogecoin, especially during a bull market.

Strong Community

Dogecoin has had a robust community behind it since its early days. Since its early days, the community has been vibrant and responsible for several amazing things. This includes sponsoring the Jamaican Bobsled team to the Olympics, building new wells in Kenya, and sponsoring a car at NASCAR.

Move to Proof-of-Stake

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin confirmed that Dogecoin would be moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake some months ago. Such a transition could further increase Dogecoin’s appeal, especially among eco-friendly crypto participants. That could also drive its price.

When will Dogecoin reach $1?

While it is generally agreed that Dogecoin can reach $1, the bone of contention is when this would happen. Given that it has not reached $1 in almost ten years, many might question how long it would take. But a look at Dogecoin price prediction could give an idea of this.

Dogecoin 1-year price prediction (as of November 25, 2022).

Presently, Dogecoin is trading above its 200-day simple moving average, and its performance in the last three years is over 3,000%. This is generally a good sign and portends an even better future.

The chances of DOGE hitting $1 in 2023 seem high – according to Coincodex’s DOGE prediction, the meme coin could be worth as much as $1.21 in May 2023. With 22 bullish signals and 7 bearish ones, the algorithm predicts a replay of last year’s May rally. Of course, even the best price forecasts are still speculations, as the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile.

Even with the relatively high possibility of reaching a dollar soon, the price of DOGE still has a much better chance of doing so than the other popular meme coin, Shiba Inu. This is due to many reasons that we have discussed in a previous article. But most importantly, the total supply of Dogecoin makes it possible for the token to reach $1 faster than Shiba Inu or any meme coin, for that matter. But in terms of utility, SHIB, built on Ethereum, has better utility than the Scrypt language-based Dogecoin.

So, will Dogecoin ever reach $1?

Elon Musk once predicted that Dogecoin would be the currency of the world (and Mars). But the current market conditions are causing many to reconsider their stance. Most Dogecoin predictions are bearish. However, Dogecoin still has the potential to reach 1 dollar. After all, the coin was worth only $0.005 on January 1, 2021, and $0.1715 by December 31. If it can grow that fast in a year, nothing is stopping it from reaching $1. But that might not happen very soon, especially not if the crypto winter persists.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNzIzL3dpbGwtZG9nZWNvaW4tcmVhY2gtMS11c2Qv0gFBaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjE3MjMvd2lsbC1kb2dlY29pbi1yZWFjaC0xLXVzZC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-05,How to Recognize and Avoid Crypto Scams and Phishing Attempts - CoinCodex,"At the time of writing, cryptocurrencies have a combined market capitalization of $850 billion and we’re seeing cryptocurrency ads plastered across mainstream media and major sporting events. Even though tens of millions of people around the world now own crypto, most people (including some crypto holders) don’t have a lot of knowledge about how the technology works and what its risks are.

In contrast to traditional payment methods, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. In other words, if you accidentally send your crypto somewhere you didn’t mean to, there is no mechanism to reverse the transaction—it all depends on whether the recipient of your coins chooses to send them back to you.

So, we have a highly valuable and liquid asset class where transactions are irreversible. As you can probably imagine, this has unfortunately made cryptocurrency holders a very attractive target for scammers. If a scammer successfully steals your crypto, there’s almost nothing you can do to get your funds back.

While cryptocurrency gives you the power to stay in control of your money, this also comes with a lot of responsibility—it’s up to you to ensure that your coins stay yours and that you don’t fall victim to a crypto or Bitcoin scam. In this article, we’ll be outlining some of the most common crypto scams and how you can recognize them and avoid them before it is too late, both by exercising caution and using tools like Web3 Antivirus.

Phishing scams

When most people think of the dangers one can encounter online, the first thing that comes to mind are computer viruses. However, you would be surprised by how many online scams don’t use any fancy malicious software, but rely on social engineering instead. Social engineering involves using psychological manipulation tactics to convince people to do something or disclose sensitive information.

Phishing is a classic example of social engineering. It involves fraudsters impersonating legitimate businesses, organizations or individuals with the goal of obtaining sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, personal contact details, or in the case of cryptocurrency scams—private keys / recovery phrases. Often, phishing scams will create websites that almost perfectly resemble the website of the business or organization they’re impersonating.

For example, a very common type of phishing crypto scam is to target the customers of a crypto wallet company, for example Ledger. Scammers would impersonate Ledger with a carefully crafted email or website, and urge users to “verify their recovery phrase” or something similar. If the user falls for the trick and discloses their recovery phrase to the scammers, that’s all they need to completely drain the contents of the victim’s wallet.

Another common target of crypto phishing scams are cryptocurrency exchange users. For example, scammers could create a fake version of the Binance website and manipulate users to access the website. Once the user is on the fake website, they would be prompted to input their username and password, which the scammer would then steal.

The way to combat phishing is to stay vigilant. Bookmark the websites you’re using for your crypto transactions, so you can be sure that you’re accessing the same, legitimate website every time. There have been examples of crypto scammers buying advertising for their fake websites on search engines, which would place the fake websites at the top of the search results.

If you get an unsolicited email or chat message that’s supposedly from an exchange, wallet or other crypto project’s customer support team, be very careful about the links contained in the message—they could contain malware or lead you to a malicious website. Also, always remember that a legitimate business would never ask you for your private keys or recovery phrase. Your private keys and recovery phrase are for your eyes only—never share them with anyone.

Malicious smart contracts

With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), a growing number of crypto holders is now actually using their coins in decentralized applications, instead of just holding them passively. While this is a great step forward for the adoption of crypto, it also comes with its own pitfalls. DeFi protocols can be highly complex, and most users do not have the knowledge or time to fully understand their intricacies.

Before users interact with smart contracts, they need to approve transactions with their wallet. New types of crypto scams attempt to trick users into approving malicious transactions that drain their wallet. For example, you might be tricked into thinking that approving a transaction would result in some of your coins being staked to earn yield. In reality, the transaction you approved would take all the tokens out of your wallet and send it to an address controlled by a scammer.

It’s impossible to expect most people to have the technical knowledge required to sniff out a malicious smart contract by looking at the smart contract itself. Instead, the best way to avoid becoming a victim is to be vigilant in avoiding social engineering attacks through social media and chat platforms, which is how scammers direct users to these malicious contracts. Any unsolicited invitations or promotions to register on a website or use a smart contract should be viewed with extreme skepticism and caution.

Tools like Web3 Antivirus can help you detect phishing and malicious smart contracts

While you can go a long way towards protecting your crypto just by exercising caution, you can take the security of your crypto to the next level by using a tool such as Web3 Antivirus. Web3 Antivirus is a browser extension that helps protect users against phishing and malicious smart contracts. Web3 Antivirus is available for free, and currently supports the Ethereum blockchain.

The Web3 Antivirus extension will warn you whenever you’re trying to access a website that has been flagged as a phishing website. The extension has access to thousands of databases of malicious websites, which significantly improves the chances that it will be able to protect you.

Another way that Web3 Antivirus protects crypto users is to analyze the transactions you are about to sign with your crypto wallet.

The extension has access to an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) environment where the transaction is executed in a sandboxed environment, allowing the extension to show you exactly what the results of approving the transaction would be. This gives you very valuable information when deciding whether to approve a transaction or not. The extension also provides a report that assigns a risk score to the transaction that’s pending for approval.

The bottom line—crypto is a world of countless opportunities and risks

Cryptocurrencies are a great tool, but they have their own set of unique risks that unfortunately makes them an attractive target for scammers. Thankfully, you can considerably improve your chances of staying safe just by exercising caution and common sense—if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. To protect yourself against some of the more insidious types of crypto scams, it’s certainly worth considering tools like Web3 Antivirus to benefit from phishing detection and transaction simulation capabilities.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxOTcxL2hvdy10by1hdm9pZC1jcnlwdG8tc2NhbXMv0gFBaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjE5NzEvaG93LXRvLWF2b2lkLWNyeXB0by1zY2Ftcy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Orbit Bridge has over $12 billion in trading volume to date and holds nearly $200 million in TVL. Adding support to The Open Network (TON), Orbit Bridge will enable the ORBS token to be used on the TON blockchain.

Official Launch Partnership with Megaton Finance DEX

Megaton Finance, a highly anticipated DEX-AMM protocol to be launched on the TON blockchain, has chosen the Orbs project as its official launch partner. This means that the ORBS token can be used for liquidity pooling and other functions in this DeFi protocol. Megaton Finance aims to become the connectivity protocol of the DeFi ecosystem by connecting the TON blockchain to other Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum.

Megaton Finance will be the first autonomous protocol to offer DeFi products such as swap, pair deposit, and yield farming within the TON network. Megaton's other goal is to integrate Telegram in the future and become the main gateway for Web3.

Services Orbs Can Provide on the TON Blockchain

Orbs, a Layer-3 infrastructure layer newly included in the TON ecosystem, will provide new use cases for protocols running on this network. The Open Network ecosystem, which has been developing rapidly recently, has continued to grow with the launch of two services using Orbs' technology: Ton Verifier and Ton Minter.

TON Verifier is an open-source application for publishing verified source code for on-chain smart contracts

TON Minter: Official tool for distributing Alttokens (Jettons)

What is Ozys?

Ozys, a leading blockchain technology based in South Korea, always aims to be at the forefront of innovation in this industry. Being the main contributor of Megaton Finance, Ozys has many flagship protocols like KLAYswap and MeshSwap.

While developing these protocols, objectives such as establishing a decentralized, transparent, and trust-based autonomous financial system, proposing standardized specifications for fragmented blockchain systems through cross-chain technology, and contributing to the dissemination of blockchain-based autonomous financial systems were pursued.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIyNTcxL29yYnMtdG9rZW4tYWRkZWQtdG8tb3JiaXQtYnJpZGdlLW5vdy1hdmFpbGFibGUtb24tdG9uLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tYW5kLW1lZ2F0b24tZmluYW5jZS_SAXxodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMjU3MS9vcmJzLXRva2VuLWFkZGVkLXRvLW9yYml0LWJyaWRnZS1ub3ctYXZhaWxhYmxlLW9uLXRvbi1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWFuZC1tZWdhdG9uLWZpbmFuY2Uv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-12-08,The 6 Biggest Cryptocurrency Sponsors At World Cup 2022 - CoinCodex,"Even before a single match was played, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was one for the record books.

The tournament was the first ever to be held in the Middle East and the first to be held during the winter. Qatar 2022 also marked the first time ever that a cryptocurrency company became an official World Cup sponsor.

Even though Qatar has banned crypto, the groundbreaking sponsorship is expected to drive significant awareness to the cryptocurrency industry.

The effects are already being felt in the Middle East, where cryptocurrency adoption has grown faster in the past year than anywhere else in the world, according to Chainalysis.

With crypto companies and blockchain platforms expected to power fan experiences at the World Cup, we’ll take a look at the biggest cryptocurrency sponsors at Qatar 2022.

Biggest Cryptocurrency Sponsors at World Cup 2022

While it was the first and arguably the biggest brand to join the list of corporate sponsors, Crypto.com isn’t the only cryptocurrency sponsor at the World Cup.

Algorand became the first blockchain company to become an official World Cup 2022 sponsor. The company also partnered with FIFA to develop a cryptocurrency strategy, including marketing soccer-related NFTs, along with a blockchain-supported wallet.

Even other traditional World Cup sponsors have jumped into the cryptocurrency space to help provide unique fan experiences in Qatar. VISA, Budweiser, and Coca-Cola have all created NFTs designed to engage football fans ahead of Qatar 2022.

Many crypto brands also focus on bitcoin casinos and crypto gambling as an additional source of revenue. For example, LuckyBlock, which started as a crypto rewards system, launched its casino recently.

Below, we’ll break down the biggest cryptocurrency sponsors at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Crypto.com Algorand Roblox Visa Budweiser Coca-Cola

Crypto.com

Crypto.com partnered with FIFA to become an official World Cup sponsor back in March, making it the exclusive cryptocurrency trading platform of Qatar 2022.

The cryptocurrency exchange launched itself to the forefront of the industry by securing a 20-year naming rights deal for Crypto.com Arena. Since then, it has collaborated with celebrities like LeBron James and Matt Damon, along with a long list of partners, including UFC, PSG, the Philadelphia 76ers, and more.

With more than 10 million customers worldwide, Crypto.com is the world’s fastest growing cryptocurrency platform and the first-ever crypto trading platform to sponsor the event.

Not only is Crypto.com using the World Cup to help bring increased awareness and adoption to the cryptocurrency industry, but it has also launched a few fun initiatives as well.

The company has partnered with VISA and Coca-Cola to turn soccer moments into NFTs that will live forever on the blockchain.

Ahead of the World Cup, VISA released the VISA Masters of Movement NFTs and Coca-Cola released the Coca-Cola ‘Pieces of Magic’ NFT, both of which are only available on Crypto.com.

In addition, Crypto.com also partnered with football media company COPA90 to create The Impossible Challenge, which incentivizes fans to attempt to watch every single FIFA World Cup match live in Qatar, a feat that had been logistically impossible at previous tournaments.

YouTuber and popular content creator, Thogden, will attempt to attend a staggering 64 games in 28 days. If he is successful, Thogden will become the first person in history to achieve the accomplishment.

Algorand

Algorand is an environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake blockchain that was founded by MIT professor and Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali in 2017.

Earlier this year, the green blockchain company became the official blockchain platform for FIFA.

As part of the sponsorship agreement, Algorand became a FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Regional Supporter in North America and Europe and an official sponsor for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023.

In September, FIFA launched its official NFT platform, FIFA+ Collect, on Algogrand. The platform helps fans bring their football fandom to life with officially licensed digital collectibles from FIFA’s 92-year history.

Once holders have built their collection, they can compete in quests to win rewards and official digital collectibles.

Roblox

Roblox is an online gaming platform and a game creation system that allows users to play, create, and sell their own games.

The platform also features games that are based on blockchain technology and the company recently announced the Roblox Metaverse will be adding NFTs to the marketplace.

According to Roblox Internal data, there are over 40 million games and 58 million daily active users on Roblox.

Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, Roblox announced a multi-year partnership with FIFA, along with the launch of FIFA World, an immersive virtual gaming environment on Roblox.

Roblox and FIFA will work together to create an exciting new immersive experience for football fans to hang out in social spaces, earn rewards and collect exclusive virtual items through various skill games and multiple collectors’ challenges.

Visa

VISA has long been a major sponsor of FIFA but the TradFi company has also ventured into the cryptocurrency space during the 2022 World Cup.

The credit card company, which has been FIFA’s Official Payment Service Partner since 2007, auctioned off five unique VISA Masters of Movement NFTs ahead of the tournament.

The auction centered around five unique works of art inspired by iconic goals from legendary footballers in the FIFA World Cup and FIFA Women’s World Cup. The digital artwork was designed using an algorithm by award-winning XK Studios which transformed the iconic movements into dynamic works of art.

The artwork, which features goals from Jared Borgetti, Tim Cahill, Carli Lloyd, Michael Owen and Maxi Rodriguez, can be minted into NFTs thanks to a partnership with Crypto.com.

All proceeds from the auction will go to Street Child United, a charitable organization in the UK whose mission is to tackle the widespread stigma that street-connected children face globally.

Fans can also get in on the action at the FIFA Fan Festival in Doha by showcasing their skills in the free-standing Visa Masters of Movement space. Outfitted with tracking technology, fans can step onto a digital LED pitch and transform their movements into digital art.

By taking a shot at a goal or showing off their skills while playing with others, fans have a chance to create personalized dynamic artwork using the colour scheme from their favorite national team.

VISA has also used the power of sport to educate consumers with programs like Financial Football, a video game that combines entertainment and education into a virtual football tournament.

Budweiser

VISA isn’t the only traditional World Cup sponsor that is engaging fans with digital collectibles.

Budweiser’s parent company, Anheuser-Busch, has been a World Cup sponsor since 1985, but the company jumped into the crypto space to create the first-ever NFT that tracks your team’s progression in real-time.

The Budweiser Scoreboard NFT gives holders exclusive benefits, including the exclusive Budweiser Football merch fit, access to holders-only Discord channel, and the Budverse Penalty Kick Mini Game.

The merch kit isn’t too shabby either. It comes with the Budweiser World Cup scarf, a color changing Budweiser aluminum cup, and one Budweiser Football trading card.

Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola has been an official World Cup sponsor since 1978 and a FIFA partner since 1974 but the world-leading beverage brand is jumping into the crypto space for the first time ahead of Qatar 2022.

In partnership with Crypto.com, Coca-Cola released a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs that are inspired by the unique heatmaps from tournament matches.

Renowned digital artist GMUNK is helping turn each team’s on-field attacks, tackles, and winning goals into one-of-a-kind digital collectibles.

GMUNK is known for being the creative genius behind the sci-fi look of Hollywood films Tron: Legacy and Oblivion.

The NFTs, which have been dubbed a ‘Piece of Magic’, are the latest piece of World Cup memorabilia that will live forever on the blockchain.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIyMTY3L3RoZS02LWJpZ2dlc3QtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktc3BvbnNvcnMtYXQtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIv0gFfaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjIxNjcvdGhlLTYtYmlnZ2VzdC1jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1zcG9uc29ycy1hdC13b3JsZC1jdXAtMjAyMi8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-20,Experts Explain Why Do Kwon May Be in Serbia - Cryptonews,"Experts Explain Why Do Kwon May Be in Serbia

Source: Ljubomir Žarković/Unsplash

South Korean legal experts have been giving their thoughts on why the missing Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon may have chosen to take up residence in Serbia.

Earlier this month, South Korean prosecutors said they believed that Kwon was now resident in Serbia – and understood that he had traveled to the nation via the UAE. South Korea’s Department of Justice has reportedly spoken to its Serbian counterpart in an attempt to obtain an extradition order.

Kwon’s South Korean passport has been revoked, which – in theory at least – means he is unable to travel abroad from his current location. An arrest warrant has been issued for him and a number of other Terraform executives and Interpol has issued a Red Notice, calling upon international police officers to arrest Kwon.

Kwon is wanted on charges of violating the Capital Markets Act and committing fraud – charges that he denies and has called “politically motivated.” But thus far, he has neither confirmed nor denied the suggestion that he has taken up residence in Serbia.

In a special report, the newspaper Chosun Ilbo asked a number of South Korean experts why Kwon may have chosen Serbia as a destination.

Here is what they had to say:

No Extradition Precedent Between Serbia and South Korea

Serbia and South Korea have never signed an extradition treaty. Without this, experts say South Korean prosecutors may be in a tight spot. Seung Jae-Hyeon, a researcher at the Korea Criminal Justice Policy Institute, was quoted as stating:

“In order for South Korean prosecutors to secure an arrest, Serbia must issue an extradition order, and extraditions need to be mutually beneficial. Serbia is still an unprecedented nation in this regard.”

Seung added:

“If there is no incentive for Serbia, South Korea will need to exercise public power to secure extradition. It seems that it will be difficult [for the authorities here] to extradite [Kwon] in a short period of time.”

‘Easy’ to Deposit and Withdraw Crypto Funds in Serbia

Lee Hong-yeol, a former prosecutor who now works at PK Law Firm, stated:

“Serbia is a country that takes a positive stance toward many cryptocurrency-related matters. Last year, it legalized crypto trading, while mining activities are carried out with the active support of the government. Kwon appears to have chosen this country in an attempt to protect his [crypto] funds.”

Others have opined that crypto is easy to access in Serbia. Per CoinATMRadar data, there are three crypto ATMs in Serbia – two of which are located in the capital Belgrade, while the other is in the city of Novi Sad.

Lee further speculated:

“If Kwon’s stay is prolonged, the prosecution may need to be concerned about the possibility of money laundering by reinvesting the proceeds of Kwon’s alleged crimes.”

The lawyer claimed that Kwon could even seek to invest his funds in “a blockchain-focused venture company in Serbia” – a factor that would possibly complicate matters yet further for South Korean prosecutors.

Kwon had been relatively active on social media prior to the prosecution’s allegations that he had moved to Serbia – but has refrained from posting on Twitter since the first reports on this matter were published.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9leHBlcnRzLWV4cGxhaW4td2h5LWRvLWt3b24tbWF5LXNlcmJpYS5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-24,How to Borrow Cross-chain Bridge Tokens Like BETH on Binance Loans? - CoinCodex,"A few years ago, many people doubted the idea of crypto loans. Today, decentralized finance (DeFi) is here to stay, meaning lending and borrowing has become normalized in the cryptocurrency universe. Binance leads others when it comes to crypto-backed loans – its loans are being used by numerous individuals who believe in the potential of blockchain technology and want to gain access to extra crypto capital.

Though crypto loans are becoming popular, there are still restrictions in the industry. For instance, most crypto lending platforms only allow users to borrow and use funds within their ecosystem or blockchain. Cross-chain bridge tokens, until recently, were never in the equation. With Binance Loans, though, it is now possible to obtain such loans.

Borrow Crypto on Binance Loans

First Things First – What Is Binance Loans?

Before discussing the possibility of borrowing cross-chain bridge tokens on Binance, it is important to consider what Binance Loans is. Put simply, Binance Loans is a crypto loan platform operated by Binance. In essence, it enables crypto users (more specifically, Binance users) to easily borrow Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular cryptocurrencies.

As a loan platform, Binance Loans allows users to borrow a variety of assets while using their crypto deposits as collateral. The beauty of Binance loans and other similar platforms is that they allow crypto users to obtain loans for different purposes with minimal risk. Binance Loans, in particular, offers several benefits to crypto enthusiasts.

Here are some of the key benefits of using Binance Loans:

You can use the borrowed asset anywhere and in any way you deem fit

Binance Loans supports a wide range of assets for borrowing and as collateral

Binance charges no transaction fees for borrowing

Loan Staking can be used to reduce interest payments

You will enjoy flexible loan terms and repayment options

What Are the Advantages of Using Binance Loans?

Binance Crypto Loans dashboard.

While the list of platforms that offer crypto-backed loans continues to grow, it is important to note that these platforms are not all equal. It is difficult to find a platform that ticks all the boxes when it comes to what users want, but Binance Loans, in this writer’s opinion, comes as close to being an ideal crypto loan platform as possible.

Without further ado, here are some of the advantages of using Binance Loans:

Enjoy the Value of Your Crypto Without Selling It

For most people, this is the first and most significant attraction to crypto-backed loans in general, and Binance Loans in particular. You can utilize the value of your asset, be it Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, or any other cryptocurrency. You just need to use it as collateral to get a loan that you can use in different ways.

When you use your digital assets to secure a Binance loan, they will only be locked for the duration of the loan. Throughout the period, you can use the borrowed assets in different ways, with the possibility of generating significant returns. You can even use loans secured with your crypto to generate a significant amount of passive income, via services such as Binance Simple Earn.

No Transaction Fees

Obtaining crypto-backed loans from some platforms can come at a steep cost. Transaction fees always apply, and in some instances, they are high. This is not the case with Binance loans. In fact, using Binance Loans does not attract any form of transaction fee.

It is important to clearly state here that Binance loans are offered at a competitive interest rate. This is not the same as transaction fees. Binance doesn’t charge any fees on borrowings, and the interest rates are normally low.

Repay At Any Time

Binance Loans offers the highest level of flexibility in the market. It gives users full control over how they handle borrowing and repayments. Interest rates are also calculated based on when the loan is repaid. The implication is that you can choose to repay at any time without penalty.

People will need to really use Binance Loans to appreciate its flexible loan terms and repayment options. These favorable terms allow experienced crypto users to make the best of their Binance Loans, paying back their loans when it feels comfortable and more profitable to do so.

Use the Borrowed Funds Anywhere

As hinted earlier, many companies that offer crypto-backed loans put restrictions on the usage of borrowed assets. This means that when you borrow from their platform, you will have to use it there for specific things. This is not the case with Binance Loans. Users are at liberty to use their borrowed crypto anywhere they want.

The variety of assets available to potential borrowers is another interesting thing to consider. It is possible to use Bitcoin and other popular coins to borrow stablecoins. Of course, this opens up worlds of opportunities within the Binance platform and elsewhere.

No Credit Score Checks

Unlike in traditional finance, where lenders are judged by credit scores, crypto-backed loans are available to everyone on most platforms. Binance Loans, in particular, are easily accessible to Binance users, and they are not discriminated against based on credit scores or similar criteria.

Being able to obtain substantial crypto-backed loans without credit score checks will open up several opportunities for you. If you understand how Binance Loans works and what you can use them for, it becomes really easy to borrow funds that you can use to generate more funds.

What Is a Cross-Chain Bridge Token?

To understand what cross-chain bridge token means, we need first to consider what cross-chain bridges are. Also called blockchain bridges, these are pieces of software that facilitate cross-chain liquidity between separate blockchains, thereby increasing token utility.

In simple terms, cross-chain bridge tokens are tokens that have multi-chain utility, meaning that they can be used on different blockchain networks. They are mostly created when tokens are burnt or locked through a smart contract on one platform and then unlocked or minted through another smart contract on the destination chain.

Binance Bridge is ranked first among the top cross-chain bridges that connect multiple blockchains. It connects with Ethereum and allows users to convert tokens into and back from Binance Chain and compatible formats. Binance Bridge mostly allows the conversion of ERC-20 tokens as well as a few other coins on such networks as ATOM, LINK, XRP, and ONT.

Can You Borrow Cross-Chain Bridge Tokens on Binance?

Now that we’ve fully discussed what Binance Loans mean and what cross-chain bridge tokens mean, it is time to answer the titular question, “Can I borrow cross-chain bridge tokens on Binance? The simple answer is ‘yes’. However, there may be a limit to what you can find to borrow.

At the time of writing, BETH is the only cross-chain bridge token that can be borrowed on Binance Loans. BETH is basically a tokenized version of staked ETH (Ethereum) on Binance. It is mostly used by users that wish to participate in staking on the ETH 2.0 Beacon Chain and earn ETH 2.0 staking rewards on Binance. It has several other uses within the Binance platform and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem as well.

How to Borrow BETH

If you want to borrow BETH on Binance Loans, follow the steps below. Keep in mind that the process of borrowing BETH is virtually the same as borrowing any other crypto on the platform.

Step 1: Log in to your Binance Account

First, you’ll need to log in to your Binance account. If you haven’t yet registered a new Binance account, you must first do so to proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Open Crypto Loans

From the Finance menu, select Crypto Loans.

Step 3: Select BETH and stake your crypto as collateral

Select BETH from the many options and set other parameters like collateral, loan duration, and other details.

Step 4: Confirm the loan and borrow BETH

Confirm the details and click Start Borrowing Now, then Confirm the confirmation dialogue than appears.

The steps are similar in both desktop and mobile Binance clients. However, you may need to click More before clicking Crypto Loans when using the app.

Wrapping Up

The best crypto loans are available on Binance Loans, at least in this writer's opinion. For years, Binance has been facilitating crypto-backed loans, accepting a wide range of crypto as collateral, and allowing users to borrow from a wide array of coins. Binance Loans even supports the borrowing of cross-chain bridge tokens so that you can borrow BETH and other coins in this category.

Here, we’ve covered everything you need to know about borrowing cross-chain bridge tokens from Binance Loans. It is important, however, that you understand what you intend to do with cross-chain bridge tokens before borrowing. Always do your due diligence before borrowing or entering a trade.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjc3L2hvdy10by1ib3Jyb3ctY3Jvc3MtY2hhaW4tYnJpZGdlLXRva2Vucy1saWtlLWJldGgtb24tYmluYW5jZS1sb2Fucy_SAWpodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTY3Ny9ob3ctdG8tYm9ycm93LWNyb3NzLWNoYWluLWJyaWRnZS10b2tlbnMtbGlrZS1iZXRoLW9uLWJpbmFuY2UtbG9hbnMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-25,Nolus Hammers Out New DeFi Paths with the World’s First Ever DeFi Lease Protocol - CoinCodex,"Decentralized Finance arrived as the protagonist of Web3 technologies. After a long time in a world managed by large companies, the future presented itself as a decentralized and global universe.

The creation of cryptocurrencies paved the way for great financial projects due to their transparent, non-manipulable feature that protects. Above all, the user's privacy made it possible to create an open, competitive, and incorruptible market, more similar to the interests of a community rather than a large company.

Several real-world activities took little time to pass through the DeFi mesh, with solutions that would take them to another level. For example, banks and financial companies cease to be the ‘money owners,' and their activities are carried out by decentralized service providers specializing in translating such activities into the blockchain.

Today it is possible to carry out loans and leases of crypto assets faster and more efficiently. Through smart contracts, some platforms allow users to expand their equity with no bureaucracy through a DeFi Lease.

What is DeFi Lease?

DeFi Leasing works through smart contracts that, in the case of Nolus, operate within a lightning-fast Layer-1 blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem of sovereign proof-of-stake networks. As a pioneer of this service, Nolus promises to innovate by bringing DeFi Lease into the cryptocurrency environment. They aim to be simple and ensure that anyone, regardless of a DeFi background, can use their financial product.

Imagine seeing a buying opportunity in crypto, but you need more liquidity. With DeFi Lease, you can use a down payment to buy a crypto asset and lock it into a smart contract. Before committing to the lease, you'll become aware of the interest rates. Keep in mind that there are no early repayment fees, no monthly charges or any additional fees in the process.

As the sole owner of the contract, the user decides the payment terms. No monthly charges or contract deadlines. When all repayments are made, the asset is released to the user by the smart contract.

Simply put, the user enters the Nolus platform and decides which asset and how much they want to buy, setting the asset ratio to apply as a down payment. Then, Nolus calculates the interest rate without incurring any additional charges or floating rates based on the current liquidity the protocol holds. The moment the user repays the loan, the asset (which has always been owned by the user since Nolus does not have custody of the assets) is free to be invested, sold, or exchanged. Moreover, during the contract duration, the user can liquid stake the entire leased position (when assets have this feature) and earn all of the DeFi lease interest and part of the principal, thus creating a self-repaying loan.

The customer can profit from the asset's appreciation and may even use this appreciation value to pay the loan in full or partially.

Traditional Finance Lease vs. DeFi Lease

Given the contrasting technologies and value propositions of each service, traditional finance leases and DeFi Leases are different in a few aspects:

Bureaucracy vs. Anonymity: in DeFi Lease, users are identified only by their digital wallet and don't need to expose their data or financial background. In a traditional Lease, customers undergo a financial screening to ensure their eligibility, which is bureaucratic and doesn't allow the unbanked to get leases.

User experience: at Nolus, no previous DeFi expertise is needed, given the intuitive interface even to normies, unlike the agreements and requirements that centralized companies have.

Down payments: The advantage of Nolus' DeFi is that the holder is eligible for special down payment options through staking NLS, the project's native token.

What is Nolus' Objective?

Nolus aims to be the leading DeFi Lease platform. The protocol intends to become a tool for empowering people, simple to use, and highly efficient. A perfect gateway to DeFi Financing, uncomplicated and transparent, unlike traditional alternatives, and without high interest and transaction rates.

With Nolus, more people can increase their equity, and they don't need prior experience with crypto. Those who want to experience a familiar type of financial product from the traditional world would be able to do so in a trustless environment in a well-facilitated and cost-effective manner.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNzExL25vbHVzLWhhbW1lcnMtb3V0LW5ldy1kZWZpLXBhdGhzLXdpdGgtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1maXJzdC1ldmVyLWRlZmktbGVhc2UtcHJvdG9jb2wv0gF3aHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjE3MTEvbm9sdXMtaGFtbWVycy1vdXQtbmV3LWRlZmktcGF0aHMtd2l0aC10aGUtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWV2ZXItZGVmaS1sZWFzZS1wcm90b2NvbC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-11-22,Binance Simple Earn—A Convenient Way to Grow Your Crypto Holdings - CoinCodex,"The ability to earn interest on cryptocurrency holdings is one of the most attractive propositions for crypto investors. After all, many crypto investors prefer to HODL their coins instead of trading them actively.

Products such as Binance’s Simple Earn allow holders to grow their cryptocurrency stack without having to trade in the highly unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. By combining their products for savings and staking, Binance now provides a single convenient platform for users that want to earn interest on their crypto.

As one would expect from Binance, the Simple Earn platform allows users to earn interest on a whole host of different cryptocurrencies. There’s support for large market cap coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, mid-cap cryptocurrencies like Chainlink and Stellar, as well as stablecoins like Binance USD and Tether.

As the name implies, Binance Simple Earn is a simple way of earning cryptocurrency. You simply deposit your crypto into one of the products, and accumulate rewards on a daily basis. While the returns are not exactly earth-shattering, Simple Earn is a great way to passively grow your crypto holdings without taking on major risks.

Earn with your crypto on Binance Simple Earn

The two main types of products you can find on Binance Simple Earn are flexible and locked products. Here’s how they work.

Flexible products

Flexible products provide interest on cryptocurrency deposits, with users being able to redeem (withdraw) their coins at any time. Rewards accumulate on a daily basis, but you will only be able to access your rewards after redeeming your funds. There are two ways to redeem funds from a flexible product on Binance Simple Earn.

Fast redemption (prioritize speed): A fast redemption will make your funds available instantly in your Binance spot wallet. However, you will not be receiving the daily reward for the day of redemption.

Standard redemption (prioritize rewards): A standard redemption will make your funds available in your Binance spot wallet the next day. By choosing this option, you will receive the daily reward that accrued on the day you submitted the redemption request.

The pros of flexible products: Earn rewards on coins that would otherwise be idle

You can withdraw your coins at any time with no penalties The cons of flexible products: Lower rewards than locked products

Locked products

Locked products require you to lock up your cryptocurrency for a specified period of time. Usually, the APR will be higher the longer the lock-up period is.

In our example, the estimated APR for Tezos (XTZ) at the time of writing is 5.8% for 30 days, 7.5% for 60 days, 8.79% for 90 days and 13.9% for 120 days. Please note that we’re sharing this information for illustrative purposes only, and that the offered APRs are subject to change on a daily basis depending on market conditions.

The accumulated rewards will become available to you once the lock-up period ends. If you need your funds immediately, you can redeem your subscription early. However, you will receive no rewards if you choose to redeem early.

The pros of locked products: Earn rewards on crypto that would otherwise be idle

Offers better APR than flexible products

Users have the option to redeem early Cons: If you redeem early, you will receive no rewards

How are Binance Earn rewards calculated?

Now that we understand the two basic types of Binance Simple Earn products, let’s learn a little bit about how rewards are calculated. The formula is the following:

Rewards = deposited assets * APR/365

Please note that the APR can change after you begin your subscription. The rates being offered are influenced by market conditions. If there’s low demand for lending a specific cryptocurrency, the APR will likely drop. Meanwhile, the APR could increase if there is a lot of demand for lending a specific cryptocurrency.

After you subscribe to a product, regardless of whether it’s a fixed or flexible product, your deposit will start earning rewards at 00:00 UTC the next day. Rewards will start being distributed to your Binance Spot Wallet the next day. In most cases, you will receive rewards in your spot wallet between 0:00 and 08:00 UTC every day, although there can occasionally be delays.

What you need to know about Binance Simple Earn

There are some important things you need to know about Binance Simple Earn that will allow you to use the product to its fullest potential and avoid any unpleasant surprises.

Simple Earn is a principal protected product

Binance Simple Earn is a principal protected product, which means that you will be able to withdraw the amount you deposited regardless of what happens in the market. In other words, if you deposit 1 BTC into a locked or flexible product, you will be able to withdraw at least 1 BTC even if the price of Bitcoin crashes.

This does not mean that Simple Earn is a risk-free product. You still have to trust that Binance will custody your cryptocurrency securely and not mismanage your funds in some way. Even though Binance has a strong track record on keeping its customers safe, using any cryptocurrency exchanges comes with a certain degree of risk.

The rewards rate can fluctuate daily

When you’re subscribing to a product on Binance Simple Earn, you will see the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that’s currently being offered on deposits. However, the APR you see when you’re subscribing can change on a daily basis, depending on market conditions.

So, while you can use the current rate to get a rough estimate of how much in rewards you will earn on your deposit, keep in mind that the APR will most likely change throughout the duration of your subscription.

Tiered APRs

For some cryptocurrencies, Binance has a Tiered APR system in place in which the offered interest rate depends on how much cryptocurrency you are depositing. In practice, this means that larger deposits earn less interest.

You can identify products with a Tiered APR by the “Tier Rate” tag under the current APR. Here’s an example of how it looks for Bitcoin:

You can withdraw early from locked products

If you deposited your funds in a locked product, but need access to them immediately, there is an option to redeem your funds at any time. However, if you choose to do so, you will not receive any rewards that accrued during the duration of your subscription.

The bottom line—a simple way of growing your crypto holdings

Binance Simple Earn is a great product for those who are holding their cryptocurrency for the long term, and want to earn crypto without taking on any major risks. While an active trading style can bring more profits, it also has the potential for bigger losses. Simple Earn, on the other hand, allows you to earn a yield with principal protection, and you also have the freedom to withdraw your funds at any time.

Flexible products allow you to withdraw your funds at any time while still keeping your rewards, but they offer lower APRs than locked products. Locked products offer higher APRs, but you need to have your funds locked up for the entire duration if you want to earn rewards.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNTUxL2JpbmFuY2Utc2ltcGxlLWVhcm5hLWNvbnZlbmllbnQtd2F5LXRvLWdyb3cteW91ci1jcnlwdG8taG9sZGluZ3Mv0gFoaHR0cDovL2FtcC5jb2luY29kZXguY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjE1NTEvYmluYW5jZS1zaW1wbGUtZWFybmEtY29udmVuaWVudC13YXktdG8tZ3Jvdy15b3VyLWNyeXB0by1ob2xkaW5ncy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

2022-12-20,What the FTX collapse means for the future of crypto - Forkast News,"The FTX scandal continues sending shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Few could predict that the highly-regarded centralized exchange (CEX) would implode, leaving vulnerable retail investors to bear the brunt of the catastrophe. Thousands of FTX users were unable to pull their funds off of the exchange when insolvency rumors began to swell, and now may never be refunded. The collapse has underscored the vital importance for crypto users to be able to transact quickly and efficiently across platforms.

So what’s next for the crypto industry? CEXs adopting “proof of reserves” is simply not enough to win back users. In order to restore user trust, there are a few important steps that platforms can, and must, take. In light of the uncertainty of centralized finance (CeFi), users need ways to transact and move funds with ease and security more than ever before. Individuals must be empowered to take control of their crypto keys. While CEXs are convenient and boast a superior user experience, they should not be used to house long-term investments. Amid the FTX fallout, we are witnessing a massive migration from CeFi to decentralized finance (DeFi), but in order to both onboard and retain users, there must be assurances that they will be able to securely off-ramp and withdraw assets quickly.

Uptick in DeFi user activity post-FTX

Crypto users are transacting at heavy volumes in the wake of the FTX disaster, seeking out safe harbors for their assets.

For example, Uniswap — one of DeFi’s most popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs) — recently surpassed Coinbase for daily trading volume on Ethereum pairs. Moreover, research firm Delphi Digital found that centralized exchanges experienced a net US$5.5 billion outflow on Ethereum from exchanges over 7 days in mid-November, coupled with its DEX basket rising 33.8% compared to BTC.

The case for fast self-custody

Centralized crypto exchanges will still serve an important purpose in the ecosystem for some time to come, but perhaps not forever. In fact, a Binance executive recently stated its CEX may not exist in 10 years because of the macro movement toward DeFi. To that end, we simply cannot afford to overlook what DEXs bring to the table in terms of security and autonomy. Both CEXs and DEXs have their own laundry lists of pros and cons, and users must be discerning when choosing where and how to store their crypto to meet their specific needs.

In the wake of FTX’s collapse, the classic catchphrase “not your keys, not your crypto” rings truer than ever. The danger of keeping your assets on a centralized exchange is that your ability to access your crypto is fully dependent on the exchange’s ability to transfer it to you. In a crisis of confidence, investors may panic, attempting to pull all their funds quickly and essentially cause a run on the exchange.

Non-custodial wallets are a great option for those wanting top-notch security. There are two types of non-custodial wallets: hardware and software. Both store the private crypto keys, strings of numbers and letters that resemble a highly-sensitive password. Non-custodial options ensure that the user has complete ownership over their assets. Custodial wallets are easier for crypto novices to adopt, however, the private keys are held by a third party which can come with risk.

The key to DeFi: improving user experience

Most crypto users, especially novices, have typically gravitated towards CEXs for convenience and user experience reasons. In order to both onboard and retain more users, the glaring DeFi user experience issues must be addressed.

One of the largest barriers to mass adoption of DeFi is the lack of a seamless and secure on-and-off-ramping process. If key DeFi entities are able to perfect the entry and exit points to and from their platforms, they will facilitate a much more approachable and accessible experience for all users.

Above all else, there must be trust in user autonomy over assets, no matter the platform. Ultimately, the industry can restore trust amid the FTX catastrophe by making crypto more accessible — and transactions faster. While the macro-economic environment remains a devastating one for retail investors and the crypto community at large, the Web3 revolution is still very much poised to overtake legacy finance.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ya2FzdC5uZXdzL3doYXQtZnR4LWNvbGxhcHNlLW1lYW5zLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtb2YtY3J5cHRvL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ya2FzdC5uZXdzL3doYXQtZnR4LWNvbGxhcHNlLW1lYW5zLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtb2YtY3J5cHRvL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-12-01,Why is it Advisable to Bet With Crypto from Florida - CoinCodex,"Offshore internet casino platforms have filled the void left by Florida's inability to develop a regulated market for online gambling. The state of Florida is still working hard to develop this industry. In the state of Florida, the only method to participate in online gambling for real money is through these platforms.

In the past few years, cryptocurrencies have spread all over the world, and they are only enjoying more adoption as time goes on. Naturally, despite their status as highly inventive sub-sectors of the entertainment business, online betting and gaming have not been unfamiliar with the rise of cryptocurrency until recently.

Nearly every day, there is the launch of a new cryptocurrency-based betting website, which provides online gamblers with more lucrative opportunities than their offline counterparts.

Sports Betting Legality in Florida

Once Governor DeSantis as well as the Seminole Tribe of Florida struck a deal in 2021, it seemed like things were looking good for the sports betting industry in the state of Florida. The compact authorized the Tribe to conduct online and retail sports betting. A month later, as a direct consequence of this, the Tribe released its betting app. In spite of this, a federal judge found that the Florida-Seminole Gaming Compact was in violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act after a number of cases were filed (IGRA).

As a result, the Tribe pulled its mobile app early in the month of December, despite the fact that it had only been offering legal sports gambling in the province for a period of five weeks. As a result of the overturn of the gaming agreement, sports betting in Florida will not resume in either the online or retail settings until 2023.

Nevertheless, punters in the Sunshine State are able to legally visit online offshore sportsbooks such as those that are listed in this guide in order to place wagers on the sports that they like watching the most.

Since these sportsbooks have their headquarters outside of the United States, they really aren't subject to the gambling regulations that apply within the United States, which places them in legal limbo. Players in Florida are therefore free to use these websites without fear of running afoul of the law (Source: https://techreport.com/florida-sports-betting/).

Privacy and Security

Traditional currencies do not offer the same levels of security that cryptocurrency does, which is one of the most significant advantages of cryptocurrencies in general. Because cryptocurrencies are unregulated, users have a greater degree of control over their financial resources while making wagers on athletic events.

Higher Withdrawal and Betting Limits

The answer to this question will differ from one bookmaker to the next; nevertheless, the vast majority of sportsbooks will let gamblers make higher withdrawals and wagers when they use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. You still have to use common sense and avoid getting sidetracked, but if you've got the cash to spend and don't want to be limited by betting limitations, crypto is typically the way to go.

Transaction Speed Increases

When betting on sports with cryptocurrency, you have the added benefit of being able to make bets and make withdrawals more quickly than when using conventional kinds of currency. Even though the majority of online sportsbooks are normally quite quick when it comes to concluding transactions, the process of withdrawing the money can still take some time when banking and security laws are taken into consideration.

On the other hand, as soon as you have the cryptocurrencies of your choice in your digital wallet, you are able to make deposits using that cryptocurrency and place bets. It should come as no surprise that bookmakers are able to send your earnings directly to you as swiftly as possible. Digital wallets are gaining massive popularity lately and it’s not just in the gambling sector, studies are showing that more than half of all online shopping will be done by digital wallets in the near future.

Bigger Bonuses

The majority of the time, bonuses and special deals may be found at online sportsbooks. There are many of these that are open to everyone who wishes to place a wager but there are also many of these that are only available to people who are gambling with cryptocurrencies, especially in 2022. If you stick with cryptocurrency while putting bets and you know where to seek it, you still might make even more money on bonuses.

Low Risk Value

Finally, when compared to wagering with regular money, betting with cryptocurrency typically has a lower level of risk. There is always an element of danger involved when trading cryptocurrencies, but the majority of online sportsbooks will change your cryptocurrency holdings into US dollars whenever you place a wager on a game.

Cryptocurrency is notoriously volatile. You are protected from the inherent volatility of crypto assets simply by virtue of this fact alone. After a significant win, you won't have to be concerned about the worth of your gains suddenly decreasing for no apparent reason. However, you will still need to exercise caution whenever you place a wager on anything; however, at least you will not have to worry about this happening.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxOTEzL3doeS1pcy1pdC1hZHZpc2FibGUtdG8tYmV0LXdpdGgtY3J5cHRvLWZyb20tZmxvcmlkYS_SAVtodHRwOi8vYW1wLmNvaW5jb2RleC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTkxMy93aHktaXMtaXQtYWR2aXNhYmxlLXRvLWJldC13aXRoLWNyeXB0by1mcm9tLWZsb3JpZGEv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
2022-11-14,NFT Scoring - What is NFT Rarity Checker? - CoinCodex,"An NFT rarity checker allows you to check the relative rarity of an NFT in the context of the NFT collection it belongs to. For example, you could use an NFT rarity checker tool to determine how rare the traits of a specific CryptoPunk are compared to all the other NFTs in the CryptoPunks collection.

NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent unique objects such as digital collectibles, art, video game items, or even real-world items. Carrying a unique metadata, these digital assets provide a simple technology to prove the authenticity of something. There are tens of thousands of NFT collections that serve different purposes, and users store their NFTs in NFT wallets such as Enjin wallet. Users can choose between Ethereum NFTs, Solana NFTs, Polygon NFTs and many other blockchain platforms.

In this industry, which is growing and reaching a huge user base, some NFTs are much more valuable than others and can be sold for millions of dollars. Before buying an NFT, investors look for answers to questions such as what determines the value of NFT and how to check NFT rarity ranking. In this content, we will give various suggestions on how to check an NFT’s rarity score and briefly introduce the platforms that serve in this area.

What is NFT rarity score?

One of the most important factors to consider when evaluating an NFT is its rarity. NFT rarity refers to how unique that NFT is among all NFTs in the collection. Generally speaking, NFTs with higher rarity will fetch a higher price in the market, but it’s important to understand that there has to be demand for the NFT collection the NFT belongs to—rarity by itself is not a guarantee that an NFT is desirable. Rare NFTs from collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club have sold for millions of dollars.

NFTs with rare features sell for a higher price and can offer their owners benefits not found in other NFTs. Owning a high rarity NFT also comes with some bragging rights, which some people will value more than others.

What are the most popular NFT rarity checker websites?

Determining the rarity of an NFT is simplified by dedicated online tools, which we will explore a bit further below. These websites use three basic methods when calculating NFT rarity. Three different calculation methods, Average Trait Rarity, Trait Rarity Ranking, and Statistical Rarity, calculate how rare the NFT's properties are compared to all the NFTs in the collection.

The three most popular service websites for NFT scoring and rarity check are Rarity Sniper, rarity.tools, and Rarity Sniffer.

Rarity Sniper

Rarity Sniper is a project that started with a few developers creating a simple tool for NFT sniping. Later, with the Discord servers reaching more than 250 thousand users, the tool was further developed and a public NFT rarity tool was released. The website is able to sort NFTs in their collection of over 1000 NFTs by rarity.

There are many features on the website, such as upcoming NFT drops, the ability to search collections by properties, collection statistics, and new NFT collections. Rarity Sniper has also added a Buy Now button for NFTs in OpenSea. For more info about the leading NFT rarity checker platform, check out our Rarity Sniper review.

Rarity.tools

Rarity.tools is a platform that can sort collectible NFTs by rarity. This platform, which can be used to determine how rare any NFT in the collection is, allows us to compare NFTs with each other.

A Rarity Score is given for each feature of the NFT in rarity.tools. When the rarity scores of all traits are added together, the NFT reaches a final NFT score, and the rarity scores of all NFTs in the collection are ranked from highest to lowest. Rarity.tools has a customized scoring system for each collection. The flagship feature of the platform is Top Bottom Matching.

Rarity Sniffer

The Rarity Sniffer is one of the first NFT rarity checkers released. Supporting new collections almost every day, Rarity Sniffer has added collections to its homepage, making it easier to check for rarity.

More than 10,000 collections are listed on Rarity Sniffer as of November 2022. If you want to check NFT rarity but can't find a website that supports the collection, you should definitely take a look at Rarity Sniffer. The trending NFT platform claims to have the largest archive of NFT collections on the web.

How to check NFT rarity?

Rarity checker NFT tools usually calculate the rarity according to the Rarity Score approach. Rarity checkers, which calculate the properties and density of all NFTs within a collection with an advanced algorithm, give each NFT a reliable rarity score. There can be more than 1000x price difference between two NFTs in a collection. That's why before buying an NFT, it's a good idea to check how much it should cost with a tool like rarity.tools.

Let's learn about the rarity of an NFT in the CryptoPunks NFT collection by going to the rarity.tools website. This step-by-step guide will give you a better understanding of how the NFT scoring and ranking process works.

When we enter the website, we can see the All Collections section by scrolling down a bit. Here we can sort the NFT collections according to 10 different filtering methods, and see the statistics of the collection by searching by project name. I choose the CryptoPunks collection.

When we enter the collection page, there are options in the left navigation bar that allow us to make detailed filters. In the middle section, we can change the ranking method and decide for ourselves how to rank the NFTs. We can also customize applied weightings. The common NFT rarity check methods are Rarity Score, Trait Rarity, Statistical Rarity, and Average Rarity.

To measure the rarity score of the albino female CryptoPunk #9876 with hat and pink hair, purple lipstick and eye patch, I type the NFT ID in the left navigation bar.

NFT scored 178.09 with rarity.tools v2 measurements. This makes the NFT the 818th rarest NFT in the collection. When I make the same measurement with the rarity.tools v1 method, the NFT is the 798th NFT at its rarest. Considering there are 10,000 NFTs in the collection, 818 isn't a bad ranking.

In the interface we can also see the Punk Type Value of the collection and many useful charts.

Final thoughts

There are many different tools that allow us to know how rare an NFT is before we buy an NFT. Every rarity tool and calculation method are useful and can prevent you from overpaying for an NFT. Rarity.tools has become the most popular NFT scores tool thanks to its filtering and statistics features.

You can use these tools to potentially find rare NFTs that can be acquired for a good price. Each of these tools is free, which may come in handy on your next gem NFT hunt. When you find the right analysis tools and know how to use them, you can start making more profitable investments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMjI5L25mdC1zY29yaW5nLXdoYXQtaXMtbmZ0LXJhcml0eS1jaGVja2VyL9IBTmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuY29pbmNvZGV4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMjI5L25mdC1zY29yaW5nLXdoYXQtaXMtbmZ0LXJhcml0eS1jaGVja2VyLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
